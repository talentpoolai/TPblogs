As a company owner or HR manager, you always feel good when you receive thousands of applications for a job vacancy.

But at the same time, HR recruiters may feel overwhelmed as they have to sift through piles of resumes to find the best talent. Imagine the sheer amount of time they spend scanning each resume to determine the applicant’s suitability for the job opening!

Collating data manually takes a significant amount of time and energy for recruiters. It is also prone to human error and results in increased hiring costs and reduced productivity.

**_In fact, according to the Recruiter & Employer Sentiment Survey MRI Network, 56% of recruiters say that long hiring processes make it harder for them to find good employees._**

So, how do you make a quick and efficient hiring decision with all the unstructured information cluttering your database? _This is where the resume parsing comes in._

A resume parsing software automatically scans the resumes and extracts the applicant’s relevant educational qualifications, work experience, skills, and certifications.

Let’s discuss in detail what resume parsing is, how it works, and the benefits it offers.

## **What Is Resume Parsing?**

Resume Parsing is the method of converting free-form resumes into structured information, suitable for storage, reporting, and manipulation.

Resume parser tool examines a resume, extracts the desired information, and stores it in a database with unique entry. It automatically recognizes relevant terms in a CV. Info such as a candidate's educational qualifications, skills used during employment, years of experience using certain skills, and more.

Once the resume has been analyzed, a recruiter can search the database for keywords and phrases to find a list of candidates who are a good fit for the job.

## **How Does Resume Parsing Work?**

Resume parsing begins with uploading all applications for a specific position into the ATS software. This can be done either manually or automatically.

Once the applications are submitted, resume parsing software scans each document and extracts all relevant information and applications based on the needs of the recruiter. Usually, relevant information includes specific job skills, work experience, educational credentials, contact information, and professional certifications

The time hiring managers would have spent manually reading through each application is instead saved by parsing software. This basically identifies and groups the applications with the pertinent information or eliminates those candidates without it.

## **Types of Resume Parsing**

Usually, there are three kinds of [resume parsing](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/recruitment-management-software-benefits/) software available in the market:

### **1\. Keyword-Based Resume Parser**

A keyword-based resume parser is the simplest type of parser that identifies words, phrases, and basic patterns in the resume’s text. It then uses simple heuristic algorithms to extract information around those words.

For example, if the HR recruiter is searching for a Pin Code, then they would assume the surrounding keywords are an address. One of the disadvantages of this type of parser is that it cannot find data that is not surrounded by specific keywords.

### 2\. **Grammar-Based Resume Parser**

A grammar-based parsing tool uses numerous grammatical rules to understand the context of each word in the resume or cover letter. It combines specific words and phrases to form intricate sentences that convey the meaning of each sentence in the resume.

This type of parsing is beneficial in understanding the impact of skills in a resume. Usually, it is more complicated than keyword-based parsing but captures more accurate and specific details.

### 3\. **Statistical Parsers**

A statistical parser seeks to identify the structure of a resume by applying numerical models of text. It captures specific elements of a resume or cover letter by distinguishing between multiple contexts of the same word or phrase.

## **What Are the Advantages of Resume Parsing?**

Resume parsing can help you find the best talent available for a particular position. Let’s discuss some of the other benefits that it offers:

### 1\. **JD Match to recommend the right candidates**

Resume parsing can help you to find the right candidates that match the job description of your company’s open position. Since the tool can sort candidates quickly based on pre-defined skills, the HR team can screen out unqualified resumes and ensures that only the best candidates are considered for the position. It increases the chances of finding the candidate that is the best fit for the open role.

### 2\. **Recruitment Process Acceleration**

Resume parsing can save hiring managers hours spent. Tasks such as manually reading through each resume, identifying and sorting resumes with relevant skills and information, and eliminating others. This speeds up the hiring process, thereby saving time and reducing the recruiter’s effort. As a result, HRs can spend their time more efficiently on tasks that cannot be automated, such as interviewing qualified applicants.

### 3\. **Record-Keeping Efficiency**

Resume parsing software also saves resumes for easy retrieval, keeping them organized and accessible for future needs. This makes it easier for a hiring manager to stay organized and work efficiently, which is important when a job posting brings in hundreds or thousands of applicants.

### 4\. **Hiring Errors Minimisation**

Using [recruitment management software](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/3-basic-signs-your-company-needs-recruitment-software/) to sort resumes ensures that you do not miss any important keywords in applications. While manually scanning resumes for these words and qualifications can be effective, resume parsing software can scan multiple resumes qui ckly and with a low chance of error.

### 5\. **Data Consistency**

A resume parser ensures that your candidate data is consistent regardless of how many resumes you parse per day. Before incorporating a resume parser into HR activities, all you need to do is configure custom parameters and parsing format. Once you've established a data storage system that meets your needs, parsing and analyzing additional candidate data will be a breeze.

## **Conclusion**

By employing the resume parsing technique in your end-to-end recruitment process, you can streamline the applicant screening process. [Resume parsing software](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/remote-working-collaboration-tools/) can do in seconds what humans can do in hours. Regardless of the size of the firm, investing in a resume parser tool will boost your hiring team's productivity and lower costs. You will get the best candidates for each position every time and with much less effort.
