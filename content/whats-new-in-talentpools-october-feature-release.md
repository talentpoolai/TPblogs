This month has some new features and some upgrades to offer more support to the recruiter, provide flexibility to the vendors, and ensure a better user experience in the recruitment management system. Let's take a look!

## **What are the Feature Updates in Talentpool's October Release?**

### **1\. Instant In-App Chat Support**

The in-app chat support will change the way recruiters approach the Talentpool platform.

It strengthens trust and protects decision-making during crucial hiring processes.

#### **_Key Advantages_**
- **Reduce dependency:** Vendors can manage candidate data independently without admin or IT's help.
- **Data accuracy:** Ensures consistent and clean records within the system.
