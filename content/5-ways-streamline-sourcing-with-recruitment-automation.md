Hiring a new candidate for any job role takes time, effort, and money. The process is a lot more complex in the digital world because job seekers are present on multiple platforms.

The days of manually sifting through resumes, scheduling interviews, and meeting every candidate are not sustainable. This is where recruitment automation is simplifying the process and making it streamlined for both candidates and recruiters.

Let's look at five ways in which [recruitment automation](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/11-ways-recruitment-automation-reshape-recruiting-process/) bridges important gaps and helps recruiters find quality candidates with speed and efficiency. 

## **1\. Effective Candidate Screening**

This is the first and most time-consuming step in the recruitment process because candidates apply for jobs through multiple channels. However, recruiters no longer need to individually visit various channels - social media, job portals, the company's website, etc. - to pull resumes.

The use of recruitment software ensures that there is no resume data leakage from any channel. The software can identify resumes that meet the qualifications and needs of the role and pull them into a centralized location. This makes it easy for recruiters to access relevant resumes on a single, unified platform. 

## **2\. Interview Pre-Qualification** 

Resumes often share what the candidate thinks recruiters want to know. However, recruiters still need to sift through a large number of resumes to shortlist the ones they would like to interview.

A way to shorten this process is to invite candidates to fill out a pre-interview questionnaire. Questions can range from "How soon can you start working?" to "What is your expected annual salary?"

Recruitment automation helps recruiters disqualify a whole set of candidates, thus narrowing down the talent pool to the most relevant ones. 

## **3\. Chatbot Engagement**

Chatbots or conversational agents are automating a wide range of recruitment-related communication and making life easier for recruiters.

They can be integrated into websites, messenger apps, and social media messenger services and programmed to respond to candidates' most commonly asked queries, such as "Where is your office located?" or "What should I bring along with me for the job interview?"

Chatbots can also approach relevant candidates who may be passively looking for jobs with a conversational nudge. Since chatbots are available 24/7, they ensure that no query goes unaddressed. Further, the conversations translate to a valuable data source that can prove insightful to recruiters.  

## **4\. AI-Based Assessment** 

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the hiring process. AI-based assessment enables companies to scale the hiring process by bringing in intelligence, intuition, and speed.

For instance, it enables companies to reduce hiring biases that arise when recruiters manually sift through resumes, thus helping them meet diversity goals.

The key to AI-based assessment success is to program it well and ensure that existing biases do not creep into the software. 

## **5\. Video Interview Analysis**

Today, companies may ask candidates to submit a pre-interview selfie-style video. In the video, they must record themselves responding to several standardized questions such as "Share an example of a time when you played a leadership role in your last job."

Sifting through so many videos is time-consuming. Instead, the recruiter can instruct the [recruitment automation](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/) to compile the video bytes of multiple candidates featuring specific questions into one or more videos.

The unnecessary parts are all edited out. These brief video clips help recruiters identify the best candidates to be interviewed in the shortest time.  

## In Conclusion

By leveraging the power of recruitment automation, companies can save time, effort, and costs.

The role of recruiters is to engage at a higher level and leave all the manual efforts to the tech-enabled solutions. Plus, the use of recruitment automation makes the recruitment process more streamlined for candidates, making it a win-win for companies, recruiters, and candidates.
