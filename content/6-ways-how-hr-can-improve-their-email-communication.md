Writing quality emails has become an unsaid rule of people management. It’s not a quality that we look out for, but it sure helps to have the right skills and create a lasting impression. 

An unclear email can lead to a domino effect of errors, misinformation, and confusion. Especially as an HR associate, your emails become a representation of your virtual personality. A potential candidate can decipher the tone and voice of an establishment merely based on this first impression.

Additionally, this piece of writing helps the candidate take you seriously. When done correctly, they also help grab attention and avoid looking like spam mail.

When recruiting new talent into an establishment, this email communication becomes elementary in setting the right foot forward. Below we discuss some tips and points to help an HR professional enhance their email communications with candidates. 

## **Six Critical Factors to Consider While Email Communication**

### **01\. Ensure Brevity**

Rule number one of any piece of information content: **“keep it short and sweet.”** Lengthy emails with irreverent information become counterproductive to the communication [process](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/slow-recruitment-process/). Break your email into bullet points in your mind and only articulate them precisely.

If you must share additional information that would compromise the brevity of your emails, you can use hyperlinks and attachments. This is typically information that is already available elsewhere or not as important.

### **02\. Email Structure is a Driving Force**

A well-structured email is like a good movie, they must contain a defined start, middle, and ending. The mail must flow from one point to the other seamlessly. This is possible by breaking down each of the pointers into small and readable paragraphs.

You will need to have the ideal subject line for your email. **Over 47% of all email recipients decide if an email is worth the open, based on the subject line.** Your subject line must have the following qualities: **short, authentic, to the point, and have personalization**. You might wish to test a few options out before you find the ideal match. 

Start your emails with **a hook-line that explains the purpose of the email with a two-line summary.** This hook provided context to the candidate and encouraged them to read further into the mail. 

The three most **essential pieces of information** that make a good email for candidates are the **company name, information about the position or role, and the reference or source of this hiring.** 

The main body of your mail must remain fueled by information. Clear all the doubts of the candidate without violating brevity. **Use links and references here to keep your messaging concise**. 

Additionally, the mail should crescendo to the primary objective of the [communication](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/6-ways-how-hr-can-improve-their-email-communication/) towards its end.

### **03\. Explains The Next Step Clearly**

The closing of the email must provide action. Thank the candidate, explain your eagerness and prompt them to take suitable actions like fill a form, revert to the mail, set up interviews, or provide additional documents.  

An incorrect closing could also confuse your candidate, so ensure you keep making your point clear. Explains what, how, and when the reply for the candidate must occur.

### **04\. Personalization** 

Unfortunately, today, **around 70% of email communication to candidates is templated and impersonal**. Studies show that an email with attention to personalization gets a six-time higher open rate.

For starters, use their name and **do not refer to them as “candidate” or “aspirant.**” Highlight the previous conversations with them or mention aspects of their profile that make them the right fit. You can go a step further and pick specific achievements or moments from their LinkedIn profile that got your attention. 

Personalization also adds a layer of authenticity to auto-generated servers that spam a candidates' inbox. This helps to build trust with your communication. This conversation tone is constructive when hiring top-level or role-specific candidates. 

### **05\. Stick to the Context**

It is equally important to know in what context the emails are written, and it is required to stick to the same context throughout the email. 

As an HR, it is necessary to understand the need for an excellent email to further carry this practice forward with a candidate. Notice your inbound emails and make mental notes about the aspects that interest you.

A good email should not have too many pointers. It should discuss the single agenda and should **start with a relevant subject line as well as end with a concrete call to action**. Your emails should help you to stand out from the spam and the clutter of employment [platforms](https://www.thetalentpool.ai) and other companies.    

### **06\. Master the Art of Follow up**

As a recruiter, you might often discover the need to send a follow-up email. In such a case, you should further enhance personalization to build trust. Request for a response, provide a reason for follow-up and ask the candidate if there is any more information they need from you. 

Additionally, a study from **Yesware saw a 30% response rate to the first email and 14% to the fourth.** This research further reinforces the need to create the most accurate email in the first attempt. 

## **In Closing**

Prepare email templates for all occasions. You can customize them when needed to save time. Over a period you can master the formula to balance communication. Seek feedback from a few members of your team on these templates. 

Lastly, pay attention to the basic details like an email signature, matching the voice of your business, readable fonts, colors, and sizes. Add the appropriate branding to your emails to match the aesthetics of your business.
