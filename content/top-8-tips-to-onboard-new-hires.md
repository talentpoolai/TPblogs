During this time, employers have the opportunity to set the tone for their employee's entire experience with the company and set them on the right path to success.

To help you with this, we've listed the top 8 tips to help you onboard a recruit and start on the right foot.

## **1\. Arrange an Induction Program** 

New employees are an important asset of any business. To ensure that new hires become successful and valuable assets, you should consider running an induction program to help them settle in.

An induction program is, in effect, the first step in introducing new employees to their position. It is a process of formally teaching them about the company and its role within it. Besides this, it will give them a good feel for the company culture as they begin to settle in.

## **2\. Create Itineraries for your Plan**

When new hires join your team, they may feel a little lost. This is perfectly normal, considering they have just entered a new environment and need a little time to settle in.

It's up to you to give them a warm welcome and show them the ropes. One way is by creating itineraries for your new hires. By doing this, you can help them feel more welcome and enable them to know the company culture faster.

Planning team lunches, outings, and catch-ups can be a great way to systematically introduce some order in their [onboarding process](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/6-onboarding-metrics-most-important-in-hiring-process/).

## **3\. Introduce them to their Colleagues** 

One of the main responsibilities of a manager is to introduce new hires to the rest of the team. This is an important part of the onboarding process. When you introduce a new hire, you give that person an opportunity to meet the other employees.

By doing so, you establish a relationship between them immediately, which is a good thing since it can make the transition easier.

## **4\. Give your Recruits an Office Tour** 

The first day is always the most challenging. Besides finding the office, meeting the right people, and settling in, it's a completely foreign location to your recruits, so it's up to you to help make them feel more comfortable.

New employees need to find their way around, get their computers set up, and learn the ropes of their new job. The best way is to give them a tour of the office and walk them through everything they need to know.

## **5\. Encourage Regular Meetings** 

The first few weeks of a new job can be exciting for any employee. That’s why it’s important to encourage regular meetings with new hires to discuss their progress, answer any questions they may have, and build a relationship with them.

Feel free to either set up a regular time in the day or week to catch up and understand various things like your recruits' progress, what they like, what they don't like, and what they need support with.

## **6\. Assign a Mentor** 

When you hire new employees, consider assigning them a mentor to help them get started.

Mentorship is about helping employees grow professionally, which is great for the individual and the company. A mentor provides unbiased guidance and [feedback](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/recruitment-management-software-features.html), which allows them to develop their skills and advance in their career.

## **7\. Encourage New Hires to Ask Questions** 

You must definitely encourage recruits to ask questions and clarify doubts. This will enable them to reach new levels of understanding and learning. Further, don't hesitate to explain things descriptively.

For example, if you are speaking about an important concept, provide examples that make it easier for the team to understand. Address any questions they might have, and remember, there are no stupid questions!

## **8\. Announce the Arrival of the New Hire** 

Make sure you announce the arrival of a recruit and introduce them to the rest of the team. It's your responsibility to ensure that each member of your staff feels valued, and there are a few simple things you can do to do this.

One of these is stating an announcement at the next meeting, which can go something like this:

"I'm happy to tell you that we've just hired a recruit. Her name is Kate, and she will be starting at our head office on Monday. We're all looking forward to meeting her, and I know she's going to be a great addition to our team."

## Conclusion

Onboarding a recruit doesn't have to be difficult at all if you follow these few simple times to help onboard them with ease.

The basic premise is to ensure they remain comfortable at all times and feel free to express themselves, move around the office, ask questions and interact with each other.

Having regular meetings and touching base can also greatly help with onboarding recruits and making sure that they have a positive experience starting in a new role at the office.
