# **How to Use AI to Write the Right Interview Questions**

[Artificial intelligence](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-artificial-intelligence-changing-hiring-process) is reshaping recruitment not by replacing recruiters, but by removing the repetitive, manual, mentally draining tasks that slow hiring down. One of the most impactful applications is using AI recruiting tools to generate smarter, role-specific, bias-free interview questions.

Today, if you are still relying on manually writing questions, you will fall behind. With the speed at which skills evolve and job requirements change, AI-powered question creation is now essential for fast, fair, and accurate hiring.

According to LinkedIn\*, 70% of companies will use AI in hiring, and creating interview questions is already the most common use case in AI-enabled interviews.

This guide breaks down how AI transforms interview question creation, step-by-step workflows hiring teams can implement, the best prompts to generate personalized AI interview questions, and more. Read on!

## **Why Should You Use AI for Creating Interview Questions?**

A great interview starts with asking great questions. The right questions don't just assess a candidate's skills and experience but also show:

- How they think
- How do they solve problems
- How they collaborate
- How they navigate challenges
- How they align with the company's values and culture

But if you are juggling a large requisition load, it becomes difficult to create fresh, insightful, relevant questions for every role. This is why many teams default to generic or overused questions that rarely reveal a candidate's true potential.

### **1\. AI Saves Recruiters' Time**

Recruiters managing 15-30 roles don't have time to write excellent questions per role. Automate interview question creation with AI and get your desired results in seconds, tailored to the JD, seniority, competencies, and industry.

### **2\. AI Reduces Interview Bias**

A LinkedIn\* article states that 48% of HR managers admit bias affects the candidates they choose to hire. Even with the best intentions, human nature influences how we frame questions, usually favoring certain educational backgrounds, career paths, communication styles, or cultures.

By automating interview question creation using AI, it is possible to [reduce recruitment bias](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/the-impact-of-ai-tools-on-reducing-recruitment-bias) by eliminating gendered language, cultural assumptions, subjective phrasing, etc.

### **3\. AI Ensures Consistency Across Interviewers**

When multiple people conduct interviews for the same role, maintaining consistency is nearly impossible. One candidate may be asked strategic, thought-provoking questions, while another receives basic surface-level ones, making comparisons unfair and subjective.

## **What Makes a "Right" Interview Question?**

Interviewers usually fall into two extremes:

Either they ask generic questions like "Tell me about your strengths", "How do you handle stress?", or "What is your biggest weakness?", or go too technical without context.

The "Right" interview question does three things:

- Checks all the requirements of the position as per the seniority level
- Evaluates how the candidate has behaved or would behave
- Gives the interviewer high-signal data

## **How to Generate Interview Questions with AI Tools**

### **Start with a Concrete Job Description**

The strongest AI interview questions come from a clear, well-defined job description. Copy and paste the JD and double-check if the following information is there:

- Responsibilities
- Required skills
- Must-have competencies
- Knowledge about specific tools/tech stack

#### **Prompt**

You are an expert recruitment professional. Based on the job description below, create a structured list of &lt;no. of questions&gt; first-round interview questions that assess the candidate's relevant experience, problem-solving skills, and [cultural fit](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-to-hire-for-cultural-fit).

- &lt;no. of questions&gt; behavioral
- &lt;no. of questions&gt; role-specific technical/functional
- &lt;no. of questions&gt; culture-fit questions
- &lt;no. of questions&gt; scenario-based problem-solving questions

Ensure the questions are clear, bias-free, and map the key skills required for success.  
&lt;paste JD here&gt;

### **Use AI to Improve Existing Interview Questions**

The majority of organizations already have a repertoire of interview questions they reuse. However, with time, these questions may become obsolete or irrelevant to the shifting role demands.

AI recruiting tools can narrow down these questions to make them clearer and more precise by removing the excessively broad and unclear expressions. It can also create them in the form of a combination of behavioral, situational, and technical ones and suggest new, more pertinent questions.

For instance,

**Original:** "How do you handle conflict?"

**AI-refined:** "Tell me about a time you worked through a conflict with a colleague or stakeholder. What caused the conflict, how did you approach the situation, and what was the outcome?"

#### **Prompt**

Here are the interview questions we currently use for the role of \[Role\].  
Please:  
1\. Reword them to improve clarity.  
2\. Make each question open-ended and behavior-based.  
3\. Identify any biased or leading questions.  
4\. Suggest new questions we may be missing. Make sure they can help us critically assess the candidate.  
\[Paste your existing question list here\]

### **Adjust Questions for Seniority Level**

While automating interview question creation using AI for senior or leadership posts, adjust the prompt carefully. For entry-level positions, the prompt you give to an AI model can focus on just fundamentals. Whereas, for mid-level positions, it should prioritize execution and accountability. In the case of senior-level jobs, you must tell the tool to include strategy, influence, and decision-making.

#### **Prompt**

Rewrite these questions for a \[seniority level\].  
Make them more strategic, leadership-focused, and aligned with senior responsibilities.  
\[Paste questions\]

### **Refine Your AI-Generated Questions**

With a set of AI interview questions in place, the real trick is to narrow those questions to the core requirements of the role in terms of skills. In smart interviewing, the evaluation should be around:

- Hard skills (technology skills, subject matter, credentials, tools)
- Soft skills (communication, adaptability, collaboration, leadership)
- Behavioral intelligence (making decisions, resolving conflicts, coping with ambiguity)

As an example, when the role involves communicating with clients, then you want behavioral questions to deal with stakeholder management; when the role involves analytical skills, then you want data-driven or scenario-based questions.

## **Which is the Best AI Tool for Generating Interview Questions?**

Nowadays, there are dozens of AI recruiting tools, so a question arises: which one is best at generating structured, high-quality interview questions?

Each of the tools is best at different parts of interview preparation, and the correct tool depends on your workflow, the volume of hiring you do, and the level of customization required. The majority of standalone AI applications require combining them with an [applicant tracking software](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/applicant-tracking-software) in order to standardize the interview and store structured feedback.

The following is a list of the [best AI tools](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/gemini-vs-chatgpt-for-hr-which-is-the-best-ai-tool/) for interview questions and their advantages and weaknesses.

| **AI Tool** | **Strengths** | **Limitations** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ChatGPT** | Highly customizable output, excellent at refining questions, strong follow-up question generation, great for removing bias | Not integrated with hiring workflows, requires manual review |
| **Google Gemini** | Strong reasoning, detailed and structured questions, good for technical or strategic roles, can include market insights | Less conversational than ChatGPT, limited refinement unless prompted precisely |
| **Claude** | Excellent at detecting bias, produces ethical and inclusive questions, clear phrasing | Slightly less deep for complex technical questions |
| **Perplexity AI** | Pulls real-time data and sources, great for emerging or evolving roles, helpful for research-backed questions | Less creative output, weaker at behavioral question styles |
| **Microsoft Copilot** | Integrates directly with Microsoft 365 (Word, Outlook, Teams), great for interview documentation, aligns with enterprise workflows | Depends on Microsoft ecosystem, less conversational flexibility |
| **Jasper AI** | Good at structured content creation, helpful for building interview guides or question libraries | Less adaptable for deep reasoning questions |

## **Conclusion**

AI recruiting tools are not coming to take over recruiters. It will not be able to substitute human judgment, context, and intuition. The most efficient recruiters will be staying in the driver's seat, where they can use AI to gain speed and structure but use human judgment to diagnose nuance, personality, and culture fit. Interviewing in the future will be collaborative: AI will provide accuracy and efficiency; recruiters will provide understanding and intuition.

While individual AI applications can assist you in creating the appropriate interview questions, your hiring results are significantly better when you have an AI-based structured hiring process.
