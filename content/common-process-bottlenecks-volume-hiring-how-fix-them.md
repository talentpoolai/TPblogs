Hiring the right set of candidates is a real challenge for many organizations.

Organizations often blame the market conditions for shortcomings in their hiring process. For example, they might think their recruitment process has degraded due to market conditions.

If companies introspected, they would find many bottlenecks in their recruitment process. A bottleneck is a situation that slows or degrades the hiring process. In this blog, we will identify some common bottlenecks that delay the hiring process and how organizations can overcome them.

## **Introduction to Volume Hiring**

Sometimes, companies need a large number of employees in quick succession. Consider a global company has opened a new branch in a new city. It will require many employees to begin operations from the new branch.

In such a case, the company will adopt a volume hiring policy. The employees are to be employed in quick succession to begin operations from the new branch as quickly as possible.

Volume hiring brings several challenges for recruiters. Recruiters that cannot address bottlenecks in volume hiring cannot get access to the top talent in time.

## **Common Challenges in Volume Hiring**

Several process bottlenecks that can delay volume hiring are as follows:

### **Manual Candidate Screening**

For volume hiring, recruiters have to deal with many job applications. Furthermore, manual screening of candidate applications is a tiring task.

Often, manual screening takes a toll on the recruiters, and they may select wrong or underqualified candidates. Manual screening can thus become subjective and inconsistent at times.

Hiring the wrong employees can cost a lot to a company. Not to forget, manual screening takes a significant amount of time and extends the [recruitment process](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/slow-recruitment-process/).

If recruiters cannot screen candidates fast enough, a competitor may get their hands on top talent. Hence, there is a need for digital screening tools that can reduce the need for manual labor.

### **Complex Hiring Processes**

A complex hiring process is not feasible for any company or job applicants.

When hiring processes aren’t streamlined, recruitment becomes complex and lengthy. Candidates also find recruitment uninteresting due to a complex hiring structure.

Did you know that 40% of retail job-seekers reject the job offer due to a negative experience during the recruitment process?

Recruiters should thus focus on eliminating any complexities from their hiring processes.

### **Decision-Making Delays**

If the recruiters of a company aren’t skilled enough, they might not make the right hiring decisions. Conversely, they may also take too much time to make a hiring-related decision.

From employment regulation to economic uncertainty, numerous factors can cause decision-making delays.

### **Lack of a Hiring Strategy**

When recruiters don’t understand the job description and requirements, they can’t make an informed decision.

There is thus a need for a pre-decided hiring strategy with complete documentation. One should be clear about the techniques needed to attract and assess new talent.

Furthermore, a hiring strategy should always align with the company's objectives.

### **Unclear Job Roles**

When recruiters do not know about the requirements and job roles, the hiring process is delayed. This can be quite detrimental in the long run as recruiters also have to inform the applicants about what they will be doing when selected.

### **Involvement of Too Many People in Hiring Decisions**

Sometimes, too many inputs can delay a process.

Hiring decisions should be placed in a few trusted hands to pace the recruitment process. A clash of opinions between the recruiters will only stall the hiring process.

### **Reference Checks**

While recruiters have to be very careful while checking the accuracy of details provided by the applicants, collecting and verifying information about the background of the applicants can get quite lengthy at times.

This eventually slows down the recruitment process, especially in the case of volume hiring. 

## **How to Make Volume Hiring Work?**

Some steps for successful volume hiring are as follows:

- Start using advanced screening tools to reduce the manual burden on recruiters. One can rely on a resume parsing system or an ATS ([Applicant Tracking System](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/applicant-tracking-software/)).

- Define the hiring structure and interview steps on one platform to make tracking easy.

- Outsource your volume hiring processes to a reliable talent acquisition firm. By doing so, you can also have access to a larger [talent pool](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/).
