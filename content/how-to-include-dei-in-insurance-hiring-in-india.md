If you have worked in [insurance recruitment](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/insurance-recruitment-in-india--best-practices) in India, you have probably felt this tension: we are hiring for speed, scale, and "ready-now" skill while also trying to build teams that actually reflect the customers we serve.

That is where DEI (and real diversity and inclusion) stops being a nice-to-have and becomes a business decision. Because when your workforce understands different regions, languages, life stages, and lived realities, your products, underwriting decisions, and customer journeys get better. Not in theory. In the real world.

Let's talk about what [inclusive hiring](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/inclusive-hiring-practices-you-should-implement-to-reach-your-dei-goals) looks like in the Indian insurance industry and strategies insurance HRs can implement to consciously practice it without forcing it.

## **Why Does Diversity Matter in Indian Insurance Hiring in 2026?**

India is not one market. There are dozens of micro-markets stitched together by language, income, digital access, family structures, and risk behavior. If your team is built from one narrow slice of the talent pool, you will miss signals, especially in customer-facing and distribution-heavy roles.

And the engagement and performance upside is hard to ignore. One report by the Economic Times notes that 83% of employees are more engaged when D&I is prioritized.<sup>1</sup> That's something clearly directed towards productivity.

Also, insurance is still catching up on representation. Industry data cited in the same report shows the average gender ratio across insurers is about 27% women. That is a big gap, and hence, a big opportunity.

## **What Do the Current Diversity Numbers in Indian Insurance Tell Us?**

The insurance sector is still male-dominated overall, and the gap widens in the most "visible" roles.

A study on India's agent base shows approximately 3.6 million licensed insurance agents in India, with only about 30% women.<sup>2</sup> It also highlights that gender imbalance varies by segment, with general insurance being more male-dominated than life insurance.

This explains why many insurers struggle to build trust and penetration in certain communities, especially when the distribution model depends on relationships and local credibility.

So, one of the biggest [insurance recruitment trends](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/2026-insurance-hiring-trends-and-forecast) Insurance HRs are adopting is incorporating DEI practices in a systematic way. For instance, a Max Life reportedly increased female representation to 26% in FY22-23 and set a 30% target by FY24-25.<sup>1</sup>

So yes, the shift is happening. But it is uneven, and it needs systems to sustain it.

## **What Strategies Can Insurance HRs Take to Ensure DEI in Insurance Hiring?**

Creating a truly inclusive insurance recruitment process requires real research showing what works, from structured interviews to pipeline metrics. Here's a clear, actionable framework you can use:

### **1\. Set Clear DEI Goals & Audit Your Hiring Data**

You must have a baseline before you make a change.

- Do a diversity audit of your existing workforce and recruiting pipeline to verify the gender balance, regional balance, language balance, etc.
- Monitor metrics at each point of the process to verify where diverse [candidates drop off](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-to-reduce-candidate-drop-offs) (application, screening, interview, or offer).

This kind of audit is the foundation for measurable progress and helps you understand where bias may be happening.

### **2\. Write Job Descriptions That Don't Filter Out Talent**

While it sounds simple, job descriptions can unintentionally push certain candidates away. Words like "highly aggressive" or "must be extroverted" have been shown to affect responses.

- Define minimum vs preferred qualifications so you don't block diverse applicants who can do the job.
- Remove gender-coded or culturally loaded language.
- Include a concise DEI commitment statement so candidates feel welcome from the first read. Clearly mention flexible work, parental leave, safe travel policies for field roles, and a clear anti-harassment framework.

### **3\. Use Structured, Objective Interviewing**

This is one of the best evidence-backed DEI steps out there.

- Structured interviews that include the same questions and, same scoring rubric can significantly reduce bias compared with loosely conversational interviews.
- Diverse interview panels add multiple perspectives, cutting down on unilateral bias.

### **4\. Create Diverse Slates & Use Inclusive Sourcing Channels**

It is not enough to hope diverse candidates apply; you have to make sure they _do_.

Adopt a "diverse candidate slate" policy, e.g., at least one candidate from an underrepresented group must be on every interview list.

- Tap non-traditional sourcing networks: women's professional groups, disability forums, regional job boards, alumni networks in tier-2/3 cities, etc.
- Build partnerships with diversity-focused organizations to keep the pipeline healthy.

### **5\. Reduce Unconscious Bias with Blind Screening & Training**

Bias is human, but you can _design systems_ that reduce its impact.

- Blind resume screening can remove names, photos and gender markers up front, so screening stays skills-focused.

- Bias awareness training for hiring managers can help evaluators recognize and slow down snap judgments.

### **6\. Track & Report DEI Metrics Regularly**

To make real progress, you cannot just set goals. You need to measure and monitor them.

#### **How to measure diversity in recruitment?**

Track KPIs like:

- percentage of diverse applicants vs offers
- time-to-hire for different demographic groups
- interview conversion rates by group

Review these [recruitment metrics](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/5-most-important-recruiting-metrics-to-monitor-fortnightly) quarterly with leadership so hiring stays accountable.

For instance, Bharti AXA Life onboarded 1,000 new agents with 40% women as part of diversifying its salesforce.<sup>3</sup> That is what "sourcing with intent" looks like.

## **How Do Regulations and Industry Initiatives Influence Diversity Hiring in Insurance?**

DEI in insurance is not only internal, it is also tied to national inclusion goals.

A standout example is IRDAI's "Bima Vahak" scheme, which mandates the deployment of women agents in every Gram Panchayat to support rural insurance penetration.<sup>4</sup> The logic behind this initiative is simple: women-led distribution can build trust and access in communities that traditional models don't reach.

## **How Can Insurance Companies Retain Diverse Hires After the Offer is Accepted?**

Hiring is the beginning. Inclusion is what happens on a random Tuesday.

A few retention moves that matter:

- **Returnships and re-entry paths:** especially for women returning after career breaks.
- **Mentorship and sponsorship:** mentorship gives guidance; sponsorship opens doors.
- **Clear career tracks for frontline roles:** including distribution leadership paths.
- **Pulse checks:** short, frequent surveys and focus group discussions to catch issues early.

## **A Quick Closing Thought**

If you work in insurance recruitment, you are not just filling roles. You are also shaping how insurance reaches India.

When your hiring reflects the country's diversity, across gender, region, disability, language, and identity, you don't just build better teams. You build a more trusted industry.

That's the real win.
