As the job market becomes more and more competitive, every interaction with a candidate shapes your [employer branding](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/10-key-metrics-for-tracking-your-employer-brand/). While hiring decisions can be difficult, how you handle rejection is just as important as the interview process itself. A thoughtful candidate rejection mail after an interview can leave a lasting impression, which can turn a potentially negative experience into one of respect and professionalism.   

That is why understanding the nitty-gritty of writing a job rejection email is essential for recruiters. We will outline best practices for writing polite applicant rejection emails and provide prompts for generating the best rejection email through ChatGPT, Gemini or alternative Gen AI tools.  

## ****Why is it Important to Respond to Candidate Rejection Professionally?****  

Before we understand the how-to, let us take a moment to understand why candidate rejection mail matters.   

### **1\. Positive Candidate Experience**  

PwC research indicates that nearly 70%1 of job seekers who have a negative experience will discourage others from applying. The way you handle job candidates during the entire [recruitment process](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-integrated-technology-can-improve-your-recruitment-process/) determines whether rejected candidates provide positive feedback about your company. Candidates who get a job rejection mail on time leave with a positive [candidate experience](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/creating-positive-candidate-experience-actionable-tips/) and are more likely to reapply and endorse your organization's employer brand across their networks.    

### **2\. Relationship Maintenance**  

Nurturing a positive relationship with candidates through polite candidate rejection mail is crucial even if they get rejected. They might be right for other openings or could become your future recruiting source.   

### **3\. Upholding Company Culture**  

The way you convey rejections to candidates demonstrates your organizational commitment to professionalism and values. It enhances workers' positive perception of the workplace environment.  

### **4\. Brand Reputation and Networking**  

Candidates who experience respectful rejections are more likely to speak well of your company within their professional networks. Positive word-of-mouth can enhance your employer’s brand and attract more high-quality candidates in the future.  

### **5\. Legal and Ethical Compliance**  

Handling rejections professionally ensures fairness and equality in the [hiring process](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/7-reasons-why-candidates-drop-out-from-hiring-process/). It reduces the risk of potential legal issues related to discrimination or unfair treatment during recruitment.  

## ****How to Reject a Candidate After an Interview Politely?**** 

Rejecting job applicants is an inevitable part of the hiring process, but doing it with professionalism, respect, and empathy is crucial for maintaining a positive employer brand and nurturing relationships within the talent pool.  

Employing the following seven best practices ensures a polite and considerate approach when sending job rejection mail to candidates after an interview.  

### **1****. Timely and Prompt Communication**  

The process of rejecting candidates must happen without any delay. By informing candidates about their rejection status as soon as possible after the interview, you can show your appreciation for the time applicants spent on the selection process. Candidates also get relieved from uncertainty by knowing the outcome and can decide to move forward toward other options.  

### **2\. Be Transparent and Constructive**  

According to LinkedIn research, 94%2 of job candidates desire feedback about their interview assessment. So, clearly explain the reason for the rejection in your candidate rejection mail, whether it’s due to a highly competitive pool of candidates or a gap in specific qualifications requirements for the role. If appropriate, consider offering honest, thoughtful feedback when requested. By providing an explanation about your decision, you help candidates understand your decision and build a positive impression of your company.  

### **3\. Empathetic Acknowledgment of Candidates’ Efforts**  

Maintaining a positive and gracious tone in rejection messages is essential. Expressing gratitude for their interest, thanking them for their time, and acknowledging their efforts portrays appreciation. Encouraging candidates in their job search endeavours demonstrates empathy and leaves a positive lasting impression.  

### **4\. Offer Future Consideration or Opportunities**  

Leaving the door open for potential future opportunities is a considerate gesture. Expressing that their qualifications and skills are valued and encouraging them to apply for suitable future positions demonstrates a willingness to maintain connections and consider candidates for other roles.  

## ****How Do You Write a Candidate Rejection Email After an Interview?****  

For a recruiter, writing a candidate rejection email after an interview can be a delicate task. You want to ensure that the message is clear, professional, and considerate while maintaining a respectful tone.  

Fortunately, Gen AI tools like ChatGPT can assist in generating well-structured prompt-based r, candidate rejection email templates that help you offer a positive candidate experience. Here are a few prompts you can use to write a rejection email:  

## **Best Prompt to Generate Candidate Rejection Mail from ChatGPT or Gen AI Tools**

### **_Opening Paragraph_**_:_

### **_Feedback Section_**_:_
