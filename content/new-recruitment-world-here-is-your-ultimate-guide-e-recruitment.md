[Recruitment](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/understanding-the-recruitment-funnel/) is not a walk in the park. In fact, finding the ideal candidate today is more difficult than it was in the past.

The right candidate is out there, but recruiters often feel like they cannot reach them. Especially when everyone is vying to find great candidates in such a saturated market.

**E-Recruitment, or online recruitment, is the solution for finding talent in today’s marketplace.**

Whether you are recruiting for a whole new team or just individuals to fill specific roles, online recruitment can meet the needs of today’s recruitment market by saving you time and money.

In this guide, you will discover what e-recruitment is and how to conduct it. We will also highlight the difference between online recruitment and traditional recruitment.

## **What is Online Recruitment?**

Online recruitment is the process of hiring candidates using web-based resources like job websites, social media, and company career pages.

Using [cloud-based software](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/cloud-recruitment-software/), you can post jobs, accept applications, communicate with applicants, and monitor their progress throughout the hiring process. 

The objective of online recruitment is to streamline the recruitment process, making it more efficient and cost-effective for employers and job seekers alike.

## **What are the Different Online Recruitment Methods?**

E-recruitment has completely revolutionized the way companies hire new employees. It offers a wide range of recruitment methods for companies to reach and attract job candidates. By utilizing these methods, companies can find the best candidate for the job in an efficient manner.

### **1**. **Job Boards**

[Job boards](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/our-2023-job-board-quick-guide-where-should-you-post/) are online platforms where companies can post job advertisements. At the same time, job seekers can also search for and apply for job opportunities using these platforms. Some popular job boards include Naukri, Indeed, Monster, and Glassdoor.

Using [job boards](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/5-platforms-post-jobs-online-free-without-using-job-joards/), companies can target specific demographics and industries. In a nutshell, it is a cost-effective way to reach a large pool of job candidates.

### **2\. Company Website**

Many companies have their own [career page](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-to-create-a-career-page-that-converts/) on their websites where they can advertise job openings and accept applications. It is a great way for companies to showcase their brand and culture to applicants and build relationships with them.

Depending on the size of your business, you can have a simple page dedicated to recruitment or a separate site altogether.

### 3\. **Social Media**

[Social media platforms](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/5-tips-on-social-media-recruitment-strategies/) like LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook can be used to reach and engage with job candidates. Companies can post job advertisements on their social media channels, as well as participate in online communities related to their industry.

The type of social media employed for online recruitment depends on your applicants’ demographics.

If you are looking for professional candidates for leadership roles, LinkedIn is your best bet. However, if you are seeking on-demand or hourly workers, then Twitter and Facebook may be suitable platforms.

### 4\. **Video Interviews**

[Video interviews](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/3-things-to-know-when-interviewing-virtually/) are becoming more popular as a way to screen job candidates before inviting them for an in-person interview. They allow companies to save time and money by conducting the interview remotely.

It also provides a way for companies to get to know the candidate's communication and interpersonal skills.

### 6\. **Internet Ad Campaigns**

To increase awareness of your job positions, you can utilize pay-per-click ads on various search engines, such as Google.

These ads can either be in written form or as promotional videos. This online recruitment method enables you to widen your reach to get the best candidates. 

## **How is E-Recruitment Better than Traditional Recruitment?**

Online recruitment has become increasingly popular in recent years due to the numerous advantages it offers over traditional recruitment.

One of the most significant advantages of online recruitment is its wider reach. With e-recruitment, companies can reach a larger pool of candidates globally. This opens new opportunities to find the right candidate for the job. It also provides access to a more diverse talent pool.

Another added advantage of e-recruitment is its cost-effectiveness. Traditional recruitment methods such as job fairs, classified ads, and agency fees can be quite expensive. Online recruitment, on the other hand, eliminates many of these costs and is a budget-friendly option for many companies.

Also, online recruitment tools offer features like [resume parsing](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/what-is-resume-parsing-do-you-need-it/) and scheduling interviews, that save time for the hiring team. This allows companies to focus their efforts on more critical tasks. Software lik e [ATS (Applicant Tracking Software](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/applicant-tracking-software/)) allows for better tracking and management of applicant data. This not only streamlines the recruitment process but also ensures that candidates are evaluated objectively.

Additionally, online recruitment offers increased convenience for candidates. They can apply for jobs at any time and from any place, making the recruitment process more accessible and convenient. This can also help attract top talent who may not be actively seeking a job but are open to new opportunities.

## **Conclusion**

Online recruitment done right allows employers to reach a wider pool of job seekers and screen candidates more efficiently. It also streamlines the [end-to-end recruitment process](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/end-to-end-recruitment-process-lifecycle/) by automating many of the manual tasks involved.

Having a solid online recruitment strategy helps you secure top talent, save money, and save time. In the end, building a workforce full of high-caliber employees is essential for your company’s success and future growth.
