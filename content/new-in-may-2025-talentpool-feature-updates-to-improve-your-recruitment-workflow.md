Modern-day recruitment is hectic and has become more complicated than ever before. Be it a recruiter who has to manage several tasks simultaneously or a hiring manager who needs to ensure that the feedback loop is tight, even minor inefficiencies may interfere with the whole process.    

That is exactly the problem these Talentpool feature updates in May 2025 are designed to address. These modifications are made in order to make the Talentpool [recruitment management system](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/) even more responsive, user-friendly, and collaborative for recruiters, hiring managers, and HR professionals.  

Here is a closer look at what’s new and how these features can improve your hiring process.  

## **1\. Enhanced Maya Interface: Better User Experience Across Devices**  

### **Module:** Maya (Mobile and Desktop)  

### **Why This Matters:**

The recruiter and hiring managers must be quick in executing every task. Every single second matters to them when it comes to screening or giving feedback to the candidate or checking a status update. We have redesigned the interface of the Maya to make it more intuitive, reduce complexity, and make interactions faster and more fluid.  

### **Key Enhancements:**  

- The home screen now offers a more focused layout, enabling quicker access to key information.  

- The interviewer screen and candidate details page have been reorganised for better readability and ease of navigation.  

- Candidate cards maintain persistent linkages, ensuring you don’t lose context while switching views.  

### **Business Benefits:**  

- **Better Usability:** Users can complete tasks with fewer clicks and less confusion.  

- **Mobile-Ready Efficiency:** Fully optimised mobile views let recruiters and managers track and respond on the go, without needing to log in from a desktop.  

- **Faster Decision-Making:** With easier access to relevant candidate details, users can evaluate and move candidates through stages more confidently and quickly, ensuring faster decision-making and improving [candidate experience](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/creating-positive-candidate-experience-actionable-tips/).  

By making Talentpool [recruitment software](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/the-ultimate-guide-to-selecting-the-right-recruitment-software/) more accessible and user-friendly, we help hiring teams stay responsive at all times.  

## **2\. Option to Add Note on Timeline: Improving Communication at Every Stage**  

### **Module:** Interviewer Panel  

### **Why This Matters**:

One of the main obstacles in a successful hiring process is a communication gap, particularly among interviewers and recruiters. This new feature in our recruitment management system helps overcome this by providing the option to include structured feedback or add valuable pointers on each candidate for all stakeholders.  

### **What’s New:**  

- Interviewers can now leave detailed notes directly on the candidate’s position timeline.  

- These notes are visible to recruiters, HR professionals, and admins for complete transparency.  

- Notifications are automatically sent to relevant users when a note is added.  

### **Business Benefits:**  

- **Centralised Feedback:** All important inputs are recorded within the platform, reducing dependency on external communication like emails or chats.  

- **Timely Actions:** Notifications ensure recruiters and hiring managers act promptly on feedback.  

- **Contextual Relevance:** Because notes are tied to specific positions, they carry context that helps in accurate evaluation and decision-making.  

This feature ensures that insights from interviewers are acted upon, therefore, enhancing coordination and improving time-to-hire.

## **3\. Position Status Funnel: Full Visibility into Recruitment Progress**  

### **Module:** Maya  

### **Why This Matters:**

There should be no need to frequently pull out a report or request an update to track recruitment progress. The position status visual funnel helps you see at a glance where each candidate is in the recruitment pipeline and spot problems before they slow it down.  

### **Key Capabilities:**  

- A clear, graphical funnel shows candidates at each stage of the hiring process.  

- Includes additional context like candidate names, stages completed, and joiner status.  

- Fully integrated into the Maya dashboard for instant access.  

### **Business Benefits:**  

- **Real-Time Insights:** Stakeholders can track hiring momentum without needing to request manual updates.  

- **Bottleneck Detection:** Identify delays and drop-offs at specific stages to take proactive measures.  

- **Strategic Oversight:** Requisitioners and TA leaders gain a bird’s eye view of open positions, aiding better forecasting and planning.  

This enhancement makes Talentpool a more transparent recruitment management system, supporting the continuous optimisation of your hiring pipeline.

## **4\. Replacing Disabled Users Made Easy: Maintain Operational Continuity**  

### **Module:** Admin Panel  

### **Why This Matters:**

Until now, when a user was disabled (due to exit or role change), their assigned tasks could get stalled. This new functionality ensures seamless handovers and uninterrupted progress.  

### **What’s New:**  

- Admins can now reassign responsibilities from disabled users to active team members.  

- All open tasks, positions, and follow-ups previously handled by the disabled user can be transferred in just a few clicks.  

### **Business Benefits:**  

- **Zero Workflow Disruption:** Prevents unassigned or missed tasks during organistional changes.  

- **Task Ownership Clarity:** Ensures every responsibility is actively managed and monitored.  

- **Improved Admin Control:** Empowers administrators to manage transitions proactively and efficiently.  

This is especially useful for enterprises and large teams where user roles frequently change.  

## **Why These Features Matter for Your Hiring Team**?

All these updates are a part of our inherent promise of ease, speed, and effectiveness of recruitment. They increase the value of Talentpool as a recruitment management system that helps do end-to-end hiring in a clear and controlled manner.  

Here’s what you can expect from our May 2025 feature updates:  

- **Faster Collaboration:** Teams spend less time chasing feedback or looking for updates.  

- **Smarter Hiring Decisions:** Real-time visibility and contextual information lead to better decisions.  

- **Greater Accountability:** With clearer ownership and structured workflows, tasks are less likely to be overlooked.  

These changes reflect real recruiter needs, and each enhancement is aimed at minimising manual work, reducing delays, and building a connected hiring environment.  

## **Summing It Up**
