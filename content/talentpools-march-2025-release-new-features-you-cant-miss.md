Recruitment today is all about finding candidates faster, smarter, and with fewer resources. As hiring is evolving, so is the demand for configurable recruitment management software. According to Research and Markets, the Indian **recruitment software** market is set to grow at a CAGR of 6.3% (2024–2032), driven by rising popularity of [AI recruiting](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-ai-recruiting-is-changing-talent-acquisition-in-2025/) tools that help businesses of all sizes attract, assess, and hire talent faster.  

At Talentpool, we believe product innovation should be a continuous journey to meet the changing demands of recruitment. That’s why we’re back with another round of feature updates, designed to give hiring teams more control, better automation, and a cleaner workflow. Let’s take a quick look. 

## **New Features in Talentpool’s Recruitment Software** 

At [Talentpool](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/), every new feature is created by keeping real user feedback in mind. Check out the new released feature from March 2025: 

### **Scheduled Reports** 

Let’s take the example of Priya, a senior recruiter at an ed-tech startup. Every Friday at 6 PM, she used to manually export funnel reports for leadership, clients, or business units. To solve the issue, Talentpool has launched a new feature to schedule reports beforehand.  

This new feature in our [ATS software](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/is-ats-software-the-key-to-efficient-recruitment/) lets you automate the process and send them to stakeholders at set intervals. Select your filters, add recipients, and Talentpool takes care of the rest. It’s a must have for any recruitment team who want regular visibility without extra effort.  

**Value Delivered** 

- Zero manual effort 

- Keeps all stakeholders in the loop 

- Reduces reporting errors 

- Saves 4-6 hours per recruiter per week 

### **Zoho Sign Integration** 

If you are a recruiter operating in a remote and hybrid hiring environment, you know how difficult it can be to get that one signature on time. To resolve this issue, Talentpool **[Recruitment](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/internal-recruitment-type-process-and-advantage/) Software** now integrates with Zoho Sign, to allow teams to send, track, and receive e-signed documents without switching platforms. 

**Value Delivered** 

- Reduce paperwork 

- Speeds up approval process 

- Increase offer-to-join by 50–70% 

- Legally compliant and secure 

## **Feature Enhancements That Simplify Your Workflow** 

Apart from the new features, we have also worked on some of our existing features to improve your hiring experience: 

### **Instant Notifications** 

As soon as a new position is assigned, our **recruitment software** sends immediate alerts to the respective recruiter and manager. This reduces the delays or miscommunications between different stakeholders, especially during high-volume hiring, and improves [candidate experience](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/creating-positive-candidate-experience-actionable-tips/). 

### **Simplified Position Creation** 

The position creation section will now display mandatory fields first to streamline job setup and reduce the time required for creating it. 

### **Custom Email Preferences** 

Recruiters and managers can now choose what type of email alerts they receive, be it daily digests, activity logs, or critical action items. It ensures inbox clarity as well as higher adoption of platform communication and reduces reliance on third-party tools or messaging apps. 

## **Why these Features Matter for Recruitment Software in India**?

Here’s why Talentpool’s March updates are especially relevant for **recruitment software in India**: 

- **Scalability**: Whether you’re hiring 5 or 500 candidates, our [candidate management system](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/enhancing-recruitment-success-the-impact-of-a-candidate-management-system/) scales with you with advanced automation. 

- **Remote Hiring Support**: With tools like e-signatures and cloud-based reporting, hybrid and remote recruitment becomes seamless. 

- **Time Efficiency**: With scheduled reports and job creation improvements, recruiters save hours each week. 

- **Compliance**: Zoho Sign ensures audit trails and legal clarity for offers and approvals. 

## **Final Thoughts** 

Each new feature in Talentpool’s monthly release is designed with a clear goal, which is to help recruiters do more with less hassle. With our March 2025 updates, you won’t just keep up with hiring trends, you will be setting them.
