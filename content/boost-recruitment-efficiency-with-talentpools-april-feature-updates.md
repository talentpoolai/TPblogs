Recruiters, Talent Acquisition, and HR teams are constantly looking for ways to make their workflows more efficient and hiring the right talent within the right time. But from what we have understood from client feedback, the overload of notifications, irrelevant reports, and document approvals stuck in long email chains affecting the efficiency they are aiming for. 

At Talentpool [**Recruitment Software**](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/), we understand the real-world challenges hiring teams face every day. That is why our April 2025 feature enhancements are all about three things: Control, Clarity, Clear Communication 

Here is everything you need to know about this month’s enhancements. 

## **Admin Control Over To-Do Notifications: Put the Right Alerts in the Right Hands** 

If you are a recruiter or a hiring manager working in a fast-paced hiring environment, you know that notifications are helpful until they are not. 

We heard from several HR leaders that while task-based to-dos are useful for keeping workflows on track, not all notifications are necessary for every team member. Unwanted notifications can create confusion or even make you miss high-priority actions. 

So, we did something about it. 

### **What is New:** 

Talentpool’s Admin Control Panel now includes granular control over to-do notifications. In our **recruitment software,** admin users can enable or disable specific to-do alerts for employees directly from the dashboard. So, employees won’t receive irrelevant alerts and can only see tasks relevant to their role, which ultimately improves response time. 

## **Zoho Sign CC Recipients: Keeping Everyone in the Loop without Needing a Signature** 

The hiring process involves multiple stakeholders, from hiring managers to department heads. While everyone involved in a hiring decision does not need to sign documents, many still want visibility into the paperwork trail. 

Previously, all recipients in a Zoho Sign workflow were required to complete an action, usually a signature. This could cause delays or unnecessary steps. 

Now, that has changed. 

### **What is New:** 

**Talentpool Recruitment Software** now supports CC recipients in Zoho Sign, allowing users to send view-only copies of documents to stakeholders who don’t need to sign them. Just like a CC in an email, these recipients are kept in the loop without disrupting the workflow. So, now you can ensure every stakeholder has the context they need without requiring follow-up emails. 

## **Smarter Reports and Clean Inboxes** 

[AI recruiting](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-ai-recruiting-is-changing-talent-acquisition-in-2025/) and automation is only helpful if it stays relevant. We noticed that many users were receiving scheduled reports that often contained no meaningful data, or worse, reports they were not even opening. That leads to inbox overload and a drop in engagement with key recruitment insights. 

So, as a solution, we reimagined how scheduled reports work within Talentpool. 

### **What is New:** 

We have introduced three key improvements to Scheduled Reports feature: 

**1\. Auto-Removal for Empty Reports** 

If a user receives three consecutive empty reports, our **recruitment software** will now automatically remove them from the recipient list. This helps reduce unnecessary emails and ensures users only receive valuable information. 

**2\. Tracking Report Engagement** 

We now track whether users download their scheduled reports. If someone does not download five reports in a row, they will also be removed from the list to keep your report delivery list clean and relevant. 

**3\. Unsubscribe Option** 

Sometimes users simply no longer need a report. Now, they can unsubscribe from report emails anytime with a single click, which gives the end users full control over what lands in their inbox. 

## **Putting It All Together** 

What do all of these updates have in common? They were built in response to direct user feedback. 

At Talentpool, we believe that great software evolves alongside the teams that use it. These enhancements reflect our commitment to building a platform that makes hiring more efficient, especially for growing organizations managing high-volume or multi-location hiring. Every improvement in your hiring software can save time and enable faster decision-making.
