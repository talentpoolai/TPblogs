 So, where do you post these? 

- Job portals or boards are a great place to start, with constant supply and demand. It's also an excellent way to access CVs or forward recommendations directly. 

- Recruiting websites are another popular choice. With the right niche and well-designed job ad, these can fetch some of the best results.  
- Social media platforms might do wonders for brands with a solid online presence. Additionally, platforms like LinkedIn have a robust professional network that helps boost reach. 
- Direct marketing via online and offline channels can also help if you already have a marketing team. These can remain targeted to a narrow niche and reach people outside job platforms. 

## The Don'ts of Job Ads

Before diving into the parameters of a good job ad, here are a few common mistakes to avoid with job ads and posting:

- Lack of traction. A job posting going unnoticed will do no good for the company’s hiring efforts. Ensure you spread the word about the job posting via internal communication, marketing, and other promotional channels. 

- Inaccurate job titles can also do quite a lot of damage. Many roles/titles are labeled differently across companies. Do not just provide vague tiles without an explanation. 
- Timing of job ads and longer ‘time to fill’ also reduce the efforts of a good job ad. 

## Creating the Perfect Job Ad 

Here are a few tried and tested tips to ensure better results from all your job ads:

### Write a Better JD

The JD or job description must accurately encapsulate the job posting details. Vague job descriptions can do more harm to your job posting than good.

Remain honest and direct. 47% of workers trust that the job description accurately depicts job responsibilities. Those with that sense of detail would hardly attract any eyeballs.

Additionally, let the description be as detailed as possible. Begin by explaining the job in a short, engaging overview. Follow this with details about growth and development in the company, and do not miss out on aspects of the company culture.

The formatting of your JD can also improve readability. For example, using bullet points or tables can better attract attention. Ensure the clarity of 'Must-Have Skills' and 'Required Skills.' Required skills fulfill the essential job requirement but aren’t a must. 

### Pay Attention to Design

Nearly 51% of respondents claim they would find an ad with images more appealing than one without them. This shows the need for design in job ads. Reading just long paragraphs of monotonous text can make your ad less attractive. 

Design based on your audience. Do not pick templates that fail to meet your brand image. Use colors, fonts, and designs to attract your type of [application](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-improve-job-application-completion-rates/) and represent your company's culture and branding.

For example, a legacy brand might avoid using playful colors, while a young brand could use pop-cultural approaches. 

However, avoid using design just as an aesthetic element; it should also provide information. The aim is to drive applications and not just create an impactful top-of-mind image.  

### Mention the Remunerations Details 

While remuneration details are not the most important aspect, they are a significant deciding factor for candidates. 67% of job seekers try to find information about salaries when researching a company or looking at job ads. By providing a ball-park figure, you can attract the right fits and filter out others in the early stages. 

Mention the range or expected CTC in comparison to current market prices. There is no way to give away an exact remuneration amount, but drawing reference to the current market demands can help provide a better idea. 

If not on the ad itself, have these details available elsewhere. For example, mention them on your website, hiring board, etc. Withholding these details altogether never helps. 

### Use Recruitment Applications

Using a hiring tool or recruitment software can also make job ads easier to create. Additionally, they help speed up the process, track applicants, and make hiring more efficient. 

Most [hiring software](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/) comes with job ad templates designed for better results. Thus, it's impossible to miss out on details and easier to publish across platforms. They also help maintain consistency. 

Lastly, such software provides ad performance, reach, and conversion rate statistics. This data can enable companies to create better ads in future attempts and save costs in the long run. 

## Final Thoughts

In today’s day and age, online channels should be your primary focus for hiring. They are easier to manage, cheaper, and provide better results. In addition, 51% of workers and job seekers say an online job platform is their preferred source for finding a relevant new job opportunity.

Lastly, provide a single point of contact or department for recruitment. This person must oversee all processes of hiring – from ad-creation to performance. Such a system will help reduce discrepancies in the overall hiring process.
