Recruitment isn't as simple as it was a few decades ago. Nowadays, companies struggle to find the top talent with the required skills. Moreover, if the top talent isn't recruited by a company timely, some other company will get their hands on them.

The recent COVID pandemic has only added to companies' difficulties in hiring talent. Apart from applicants' skill gaps, recruiters face many other challenges in 2022.

In the current scenario, many organizations are hiring aggressively and with changes in recruitment methods finding the right candidate at the right pace has become a challenging task. Thankfully, several innovations and trends have helped recruiters pace up the hiring process. Let's explore some of these in detail. 

## **Data-Driven Recruitment** 

Everyone is familiar with the importance of data in the digital era. As more and more companies are undergoing digital transformation, recruiters are moving towards data-driven practices.

With data analysis, recruiters can generate rich insights related to prospective applicants for a job position. They can also automate mundane tasks.

In this era of uncertainty, recruiters need to hire the right people that can boost revenue as well as growth. Rich data insights can thus help a company hire the right set of people. 

## **Advanced Screening Tools** 

Some companies shortlist candidates based on their resumes and interview results. However, resumes and interviews aren't enough to test applicants' skills.

Recruiters use advanced screening tools to get quantifiable data about applicants' skills. Recruiters need to speed up the [recruitment process](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/slow-recruitment-process/) and eliminate underqualified individuals from the candidate pool.

Many companies are now including behavioral assessments as part of their screening process. Tools such as skill tests enable recruiters to identify applicants that do not possess the required skills.

Advance screening tools are thus helping recruiters in distinguishing candidates that have the exact skills mentioned in the job description. 

## **AI-Powered Recruitment** 

Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, recruiters are moving toward hyper-automation. Most organizations are already using interview bots powered by AI.

With the help of an AI-powered recruitment system, processes such as background and reference checking can be automated. With minimum manual effort, recruiters can get the most out of the hiring process with AI.

Recruiters can use AI-powered systems to reroute candidates and onboard new employees. Moreover, an [AI-based recruitment system](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/) can help recruiters boost the candidate experience - it can help them communicate efficiently with candidates at each stage of recruitment. 

## **Diversity in Hiring** 

Companies have to build a brand reputation in the market. To this end, many companies are focusing more on diversity and inclusion in their workforce in 2022.

Companies are now more open to gender identity and expression. Recruiters are thus hiring employees across the gender spectrum. For example, companies are now not considering gender as a criteria for leadership roles.

Recruiters must expand their horizons in terms of recruiting to create a more inclusive workforce that meets their diversity goals. 

## **Gen-Z Workforce** 

Startups require a workforce that helps them to grow faster, to move with such a pace most newbie companies are considering a Gen-Z workforce. This workforce is helping them to create a strong team to meet project deadlines.

Did you know that 75% of Gen Z employees prefer to switch job roles within the same company rather than changing the company?

Gen Z individuals are known to pursue long-term careers. Hiring Gen Z individuals can also help a company meet its diversity efforts. 

## **Hiring for Remote Work** 

The recent COVID pandemic has led companies to look for remote working options. Many organizations have started implementing the work-from-home culture. This culture helps employees to balance their work and personal life.

WFH (Work from Home) culture offers flexibility to both the employees and the company. Not to forget, WFH culture can help companies slash in-house operational costs.

## **Skill-Based Hiring** 

Instead of certifications and degrees, employers are now looking for acquired skills.

Using skill assessments, recruiters see beyond the background education of an applicant. Apart from hard skills, recruiters are now focusing on soft skills like presentation, communication, and collaboration skills. 

## **In a Nutshell** 

With the rising uncertainties for various businesses in 2022, focusing on these recruitment trends is imperative to help them cope with the upcoming challenges.

Dedicated employees that can connect with the company objective will enhance the business continuity - follow these recruitment trends to boost your hiring processes and find the best talent!
