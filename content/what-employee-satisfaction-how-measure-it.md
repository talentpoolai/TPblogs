It is a more passive concept, meaning that an employee can be satisfied with their job. Without necessarily being highly motivated or invested in their work.

Employee engagement, on the other hand, is a more active concept. It involves an employee's emotional and intellectual connection to their work. It is a measure of how invested an employee is in their work and achieving the company’s goals. It is driven by factors such as meaningful work, opportunities for development, recognition, feedback, and a positive work environment.
