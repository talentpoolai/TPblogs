Walk into almost any insurance office today, and you will hear the same conversations.

"We're hiring, but candidates don't have the right insurance sales skillsets."  
"Our agents aren't confident with customers."  
"We need leaders who can handle change, not just operations."

None of these are new complaints. What is new is how widespread they have become.

The insurance industry is changing faster than anyone has ever imagined. Products are becoming more complex. Customers are asking critical questions. Technology is moving faster than most teams can comfortably keep up with. And somewhere in the middle of all this, [insurance HR](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/guide-to-transforming-insurance-hr-with-digital-innovation)s are realizing that the roles have not changed as fast as the skills required to do them well.

And the cost is real. Slower growth. Higher attrition. Missed opportunities.

The good news? This gap is not inevitable, and it is definitely fixable if insurers stop treating it as a recruitment problem and start addressing it as a skills problem.

## **What Skills are Needed for Insurance Today?**

Insurance roles today look nothing like they did even five years ago.

The industry now needs a blend of human, technical, and leadership capabilities, not isolated skill sets. At a broad level, modern insurance teams need:

- Insurance sales skills with strong customer communication
- Deep product and regulatory understanding
- Data literacy and insurance technical skills to use digital tools
- Problem-solving and decision-making under ambiguity
- Leadership that can guide teams through constant change

## **What are the Major Insurance Skill Gaps?**

The skills gap does not hit all roles equally. Some areas are reporting a wider gap than others.

### **Insurance Sales Skills are Struggling to Keep Up**

Insurance selling today is advisory, not transactional. Customers expect clarity, empathy, and guidance, especially in health and life insurance.

Instead, many agents are still trained to hit targets before they have mastered the basics.

The fallout is predictable. In India, around 30% of new insurance agents quit within the first year, and only 13% stay beyond four years.<sup>1</sup> People don't walk away because they dislike insurance. They walk away because they never felt prepared to succeed.

### **Insurance Technical Skills are in a Critical Position**

Technical roles are where the pressure really builds. Beyond actuaries, insurers are struggling to find:

- Underwriters who can work with analytics and alternative data
- Claims professionals comfortable with automation and AI
- Compliance and IFRS-17 specialists
- Cybersecurity and data professionals

In one global study, 63% of insurance leaders admitted their teams have a digital skills gap, with nearly one-third calling it "very serious".<sup>2</sup>

The gap in insurance technical skills is not due to a lack of ambition to modernize. It is that technology arrived faster than skill development did.

### **Leadership Skill Gaps are Quietly Slowing Everything Down**

Leadership gaps don't announce themselves. They quietly compound problems and show up in morale, decision delays, and rising attrition.

Many insurance leaders were promoted because they knew the business inside out. Today, they are also expected to:

- Manage remote or hybrid teams
- Coach younger employees
- Lead change, not resist it

At the same time, a wave of retirement is approaching. Globally, 50% of the insurance workforce is expected to retire within the next 15 years, creating an enormous experience vacuum.<sup>3</sup> When senior leaders exit without structured knowledge transfer, companies lose more than headcount - they lose judgment, context, and decision-making depth.

## **Why the Insurance Industry is Witnessing a Growing Skill Gap?**

The gap did not appear overnight, and it won't disappear on its own. Here's why:

### **Insurance has not Marketed Itself as a Career**

A striking 79% of Gen Z have never even considered a career in insurance.<sup>4</sup> Many see it as outdated, rigid, or sales-heavy, despite the industry offering stability, purpose, and scale.

Perception matters. And insurance has not told its story well enough.

### **Education and Industry are not Aligned**

Curriculums have not kept pace with how insurance actually works today. Many graduates enter the workforce without exposure to:

- Real-world underwriting scenarios
- Claims complexity
- Regulatory frameworks
- Insurance technology

That mismatch leads to longer ramp-up times and early frustration.

### **Hiring is Still Too Reactive**

Many insurers hire only when roles are already vacant.

Without workforce planning, internal mobility, or skill mapping, companies end up competing for the same scarce profiles, often unsuccessfully.

This is where applicant tracking software and a structured recruitment management system start to matter. Not as admin tools, but as visibility tools that help leaders understand where skill gaps are formed before they become critical.

## **Strategies to Overcome the Skills Gap in Insurance**

There is no single fix. But there is a clear direction.

### **1. Start Building Skills Internally**

Insurers who rely only on hiring will always lag.

Instead of [skill-based hiring](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/skill-based-hiring-the-new-hiring-trend-in-recruitment), many organizations are now redesigning roles and reskilling employees instead. In fact, 59% of insurers globally are actively reskilling teams to meet future needs.<sup>5</sup>

- Upskilling underwriters in analytics.
- Training claims teams to work alongside automation.
- Preparing high-potential employees for leadership early.

By strengthening the [internal talent marketplace](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-internal-talent-marketplaces-are-changing-workforce-planning), it is possible to narrow the skill gap in the long run.

### **2. Fix Sales Training at the Foundation Level**

Sales attrition drops when training improves.

Clear onboarding, structured mentoring, and realistic targets make a measurable difference, especially in the first 12 months. Agents who understand products and feel supported don't leave as quickly.

### **3. Use Technology to Hire and Plan Smarter**

Modern recruitment is not about speed alone. It is about foresight. With the right [recruitment management system](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/), insurance HRs can:

- Track skill availability across teams
- Build talent pipelines for critical roles
- Reduce dependency on last-minute hiring

When talent is scarce, planning beats fallouts.

## **What Insurance HRs Can Do to Hire Better Candidates Amidst the Skill Gap?**

Hiring in insurance today is not about finding "perfect" candidates. It is about spotting potential, adaptability, and role-ready skills, even when resumes don't look ideal on paper.

Here is what actually helps.

### **1. Hire For Learning Ability**

Given how fast insurance roles are changing, the ability to learn matters more than ticking every requirement or having a great past experience.

What HR teams can do:

- Test problem-solving and scenario thinking, not just product knowledge
- Use case-based interviews for sales, underwriting, and claims roles
- Look for candidates who can explain how they learned something complex quickly

### **2. Redefine Job Descriptions Around Skills**

Traditional job descriptions often scare away capable candidates. Actionable shifts insurance HRs can undertake include:

- Breaking roles into must-have skills vs. trainable skills
- Focusing on outcomes (what success looks like in 6 months)
- Removing unnecessary years of experience requirements

This widens the talent pool without lowering the bar.

### **3. Assess Insurance Sales Skills with Real Conversations**

Resumes don't show how someone sells insurance. Here is how you can evaluate the candidates better:

- Use role-play customer conversations instead of standard interviews
- Test clarity, empathy, and objection handling
- Evaluate how candidates explain complex products in simple language

This works far better than judging past targets alone.

### **4. Prioritize Culture and Coachability in Leadership Hiring**

Leadership skill gaps are expensive to fix later.

While hiring leadership roles in insurance, R teams should assess how candidates handle feedback, their approach to managing change, and experience in coaching teams, not just delivering results. Strong leaders amplify skills across teams while weak ones drain them.

### **5. Strengthen Pre-Joining and Early Onboarding**

The first 90 days decide retention.

Ensure a smooth [virtual onboarding](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/a-step-by-step-guide-to-virtual-hiring-and-onboarding-in-insurance/) journey, share learning resources before joining, assign mentors early, and set clear expectations on learning milestones. This dramatically reduces early attrition, especially in sales roles.

## **Closing Thought**

Insurance HR teams don't need perfect candidates to get better hiring outcomes amidst this growing skill gap. They need clear skill signals, structured evaluation, and systems that support long-term capability building.

Because the truth is, the skills gap in insurance won't be closed by hiring "ready-made" talent. There simply is not enough of it. What does exist is potential - in career switchers, early-career professionals, internal movers, and candidates who just have not been given the right structure to grow.

This shift takes intent. But when it is done right, hiring stops feeling like a challenge, teams get stronger over time, and the skills gap finally starts to narrow.
