### 4. **Op timize for Search Engines**

Seo-optimizing your career page is important because it can help increase visibility and attract more candidates to your organization. You can increase your visibility and attract more candidates by:

### 5. **Consider Mobile-friendly Design**

A mobile-friendly design is an essential component of any effective career page. These days, there is an increase in the number of job seekers using mobile devices to search for jobs. So, it is important to ensure that your career page is optimized for mobile viewing.

- Use responsive design to ensure that your career page adapts to different screen sizes and devices. This will help ensure that candidates can easily view and navigate your career page on their mobile devices.

Optimize your images and videos for mobile viewing by ensuring that they load quickly and are optimized for small screens. Use large buttons and clickable elements on your career page to make it easy for candidates to apply for job openings.

### 6. Use Video Content

You can create videos that showcase employee testimonials, a day in the life of an employee, or a tour of the office. Video content is engaging and can help create an emotional connection with potential candidates. Make sure to include a transcript or closed captions to make your videos accessible to all.

### 7. Optimize your Application Filling Process

With the [digitization of the hiring process](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/all-you-need-to-know-about-automation-technology-in-recruitment/), candidates now want application forms that are quick to fill.

### 8. **Use Clear Call-to-actions**

Your call to action sets the correct expectations for the candidates.
