Having met many promising companies in the SMB segment who want to streamline recruitment, we have observed a pattern in how they seem to take their buying decision.  

There is no denying the fact that more and more SMBs are becoming increasingly aware about the need for a system to manage recruitment. Whether it is services or product, organizations want to take an informed decision when getting an employee onboard. This is only possible when the entire focus of the team is on getting the right candidates in the funnel.

Such companies intend to cut down on all recruiter distractions ruthlessly, be it data entry, management, hygiene checks such duplicate checks and one single place to track all candidate communication. This is where and when they start looking for a system which will help them do so. 

However in spite of being forward thinking, perhaps the paradox of choice catches on. To help you think a little more clearly, here's a list of a few common mistakes that we see SMBs making when evaluating a [recruitment management software](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/): 

## **Inability to balance between short-term fixes and long term needs** 

It hurts both ways! Organizational needs from recruitment changes post an inflection stage in the growth chart. It also depends on how quickly an organization evolves in its recruitment process. You must figure out the area where you would want to improve faster and then evaluate solutions on that basis. 

## **Getting carried away by the bells and whistles** 

Are you getting starry-eyed by the shining new promise of integration with 56 new job portals or the extra [features](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/does-your-applicant-tracking-software-have-these-features/) and [functionalities](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/recruitment-management-software-benefits/) that you would be able to use? Don’t! Look at the ease with which the software would be able to integrate with the job portal you work on. See if the software does the basics the way you want it.

## **Overlooking the hiring manager's buy-in** 

Recruitment is a collaborative process. Recruiters are facilitators who need to make the process easy for their internal customers - requisitioners and interviewers. If your recruitment management software does not make collaboration easy, it leaves out the key players who make the maximum impact on the recruitment KPIs. 

## **Looking for the low-cost first step solution** 

Cost certainly plays a role when you are a growing organization. You want to pay for what you use but do you want spend your time in user administration? Look for a product that does not penalize you for your growth and provides transparency into pricing. 

## **Underestimating the change management process** 

Last yet the most important, shifting gears is easier said than done. Partner with a provider who understands this and provides you strong support in the first few weeks of implementation so that you can smoothly transition into a new way of working.
