It’s time to rethink the old recruiting techniques! Majority of the workforce now consists of candidates belonging to the Next Gen. these are the people who have witnessed some of the world’s biggest-ever technological innovations in their early life. Mobile, social, cloud and digital technologies are practically coded in their DNA!

<!--more-->

These candidates are less influenced by money and are encouraged by opportunities to contribute towards a larger cause.They are ready to explore. They intend to change the world; they want to “make a difference”. Therefore, hiring them with those traditional hiring methods just won’t do the trick!

They are risk takers with the entrepreneurial mindset. They have learned from the millennials that traditional job choices just to earn a living do not guarantee success.

As recruiters, to hire these restless Next Gen candidates, take a sneak peek into how they think:

## **Want to Become Entrepreneurs**

Next Gen candidates want to give their idea a shot without the fear of failing. Turning a passion or hobby  
into a business or career path is their ultimate goal. They have access to more people, various resources and information way early in life. By creating a work culture that enables them to focus on new projects will appeal to their entrepreneurial spirit.

## **True Digital Natives**

Facebook and LinkedIn do not define  social networks for them! These candidates are more likely to be found active on social networks that put their thoughts in a few words with a good visual appeal! Social networks like SnapChat, Whisper, Instagram, Tumblr, Pinterest, to name a few. The Next Gen members have learnt it well from their predecessors. They like to share what they like and choose not to be tracked.

## **How to get attention from this generation?**

- **Reach out to their entrepreneurial spirit.** Offer job opportunities that listen to their  
    ideas and encourage their leadership qualities.
- **Begin explaining the job with a small message and highlight its value in few words.** Why is this job important? What will it help them achieve? Remember, money is really not their concern. They want to make an impact.
- **Your recruiting messages should be out there**. Youtube, Pinterest, Whisper, Snapchat, Tumblr. Next Gen members are all on it at the same time.

Next Gen are coming of age. They have never known a time before social networks or smartphones.

It’s time to pull up your socks and embrace the future of the Next Gen members. All you need to do is use the right combination of recruiting strategies and technology tools that will help offer these “Digital Natives” the experience they have always wanted!
