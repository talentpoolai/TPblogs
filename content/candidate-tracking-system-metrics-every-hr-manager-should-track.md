Recruiting today is not short on effort. It is short on clarity.

Resumes are coming in. Interviews are happening. Offers are being rolled out. Yet roles stay open longer than expected, good [candidates drop off](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-to-reduce-candidate-drop-offs) without warning, and hiring managers keep asking the same question: Why is this taking so long?

The problem usually is not the people. It is the lack of visibility into what's actually happening inside the hiring funnel.

This is where recruitment metrics come in, not as reports that sit unread, but as signals that show where time, talent, and opportunities are being lost. When tracked through a strong candidate tracking system, these metrics help HR teams move from reactive hiring to predictable, confident decision-making.

In this guide, we will break down the key recruitment metrics every HR manager should track, across the entire [end-to-end recruitment](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/end-to-end-recruitment) lifecycle, what each metric tells you, why it matters, and how to act on it.

## **Why Candidate Tracking Metrics Matter?**

Hiring volumes are up, but efficiency has not kept pace. According to SHRM's State of Recruiting 2025 insights, the average time to fill a role is now 45 days.<sup>1</sup>

When hiring slows down, three things happen:

- Candidates lose interest
- Hiring managers lose trust in the process
- Recruiters burn out

Tracking the right candidate sourcing metrics and recruitment metrics helps prevent this. A strong [candidate tracking software](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/signs-you-need-candidate-tracking-software-upgrade) doesn't just show you who applied. It shows you why roles are stuck, where candidates drop, and which sourcing channels actually convert.

## **What are the Most Important Metrics for Recruiting?**

High application volume feels productive. High-quality applications are what actually move hiring forward.

This is where [candidate sourcing](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/7-best-practices-for-data-driven-candidate-sourcing) metrics become essential to understand whether the right candidates are entering your pipeline. Here are the most important recruitment metrics you should monitor in your candidate tracking system:

### **1\. Time to Fill & Time to Hire**

These two are often used interchangeably, but they tell different stories. While time to fill means days between job approval and offer acceptance, [time to hire](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-to-improve-time-to-hire-with-automation) means days between candidate application and offer acceptance.

If you have long hiring cycles, it doesn't just hurt productivity. It also costs you candidates.

So, your candidate management system should be able to track time at each stage (screening to interview, to offer). If interviews are quick but approvals take weeks, the issue is not sourcing, it is internal alignment.

### **2\. Source of Hire**

One of the most important candidate sourcing metrics is the source of hire. You should track where successful hires come from - job portals, referrals, LinkedIn, career pages, and agencies.

Economic Times highlights that employee referrals contribute to 25-50% of hires across Indian organizations, also showing 20-46% higher retention rates and 25-30% faster time-to-fill.<sup>2</sup>

You should focus less on where candidates apply from and more on where your best hires originate. Then double down on those ways of sourcing candidates.

### **3\. Application Completion Rate**

Measures how many candidates start vs complete an application. According to studies, almost 60% of candidates abandon applications due to length or complexity.

If your application takes more than 15-20 minutes, you are losing qualified talent, especially experienced professionals. So, keep only the necessary fields and avoid repeating the fields already available on resumes.

### **4\. Interview-to-Offer Ratio**

Are you interviewing too many people, or the wrong ones?

The interview-to-offer metric answers this question and reveals screening quality.

A study by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) found that the average interview-to-offer ratio is around 2:1, meaning roughly 50 out of every 100 candidates interviewed receive a job offer. <sup>3</sup>

If you are interviewing 10-12 candidates per role:

- JD clarity may be weak
- Screening criteria may be inconsistent
- Hiring managers may be misaligned

Use structured screening and scoring inside your [candidate tracking system](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-candidate-tracking-software-streamlines-end-to-end-recruitment) to reduce subjective shortlisting.

### **5\. Offer Acceptance Rate**

An offer declined is more than a disappointment, but it is lost time and often lost credibility. And this is the clearest sign of [candidate experience](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-candidate-experience-impacts-your-glassdoor-reviews).

Global benchmarks from AIHR show, an offer acceptance rate of around 90% or higher is widely considered a strong benchmark.<sup>4</sup>

Usually, delayed offers and unclear role expectations are the top reasons candidates reject offers in India. So, recruiters should track offer turnaround time and maintain timely communication with candidates. If approvals take longer than 3-5 days, candidates will accept competing offers.

### **6\. Quality of Hire & Early Attrition**

A fast hire means nothing if the hire leaves. That's why the quality of hire and attrition rates are the recruiting metrics that leadership actually cares about.

Track:

- 90-day attrition
- 6-month performance feedback
- Hiring manager satisfaction

You should also map the quality of hire back to sourcing channels within your candidate management system. Poor quality often starts with poor sourcing, not onboarding.

### **7\. Pipeline Velocity**

This recruitment metric shows how smoothly your end-to-end recruitment process flows and how fast candidates move through stages.

Slow pipelines not just lead to candidate drop-offs but also cause [recruiter burnout](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/is-recruiter-burnout-a-myth-or-a-fact).

You should track:

- Average days per stage
- Stage-wise drop-offs
- Hiring manager response delays

If candidates stall between interview rounds, simplify stages. More interviews don't equal better decisions.

## **What is the Best Candidate Tracking Software?**
