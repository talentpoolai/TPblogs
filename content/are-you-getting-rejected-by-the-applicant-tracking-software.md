**Applying regularly for jobs every day but are not receiving interview calls? Is there something wrong from your end or from the employer's end? Well it's all because of the ATS, perhaps!**

A few days back, I spotted a trending conversation on LinkedIn about how candidates are getting rejected by the [applicant tracking software](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/ai-applicant-tracking-system/) based on some algorithms or rules.

Now that reminded me of conversations that we at [Talentpool](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/) often have with our prospects. Many organizations ask us for features that will block irrelevant candidates.

Having had worked with recruiters, we understand that relevance can be defined in more ways than one and it is dependent on the nature of the position that you are working on.

You can certainly add the following shortlisting or parsing criteria if your relevance criteria and recruitment policies are based on attributes such as

- UG/PG Degree
- Institute
- Percentage marks

Not only are these straight forward, these are also those attributes that hardly change with time.  Add these to your website application forms to receive applications only from those candidates who can potentially be evaluated – short term or long term!

The moot question then remains that how does a [recruitment software](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/recruiting-software/) help recruiters reach the right candidates faster.

- Ensuring that the candidate data is at one single place
- Providing search filters and flags to get to the most relevant candidates
- Adding a recommendation engine that would suggest the most relevant candidates from the existing database based on keyword matches, keyword density and contextual search

## Where does Artificial Intelligence fit into the scheme of things?

With artificial intelligence, the possibilities are many.

By gathering data inputs on pattern of hiring or the success ratio of a certain kind of candidate over the other, software solutions can help recruitment teams reach a conclusion about the candidate preferences of an organization. Based on the model candidate, a software with in-built an artificial intelligence can help you with recommendations.

This, however, is not a feature that can be used on day one.  The artificial intelligence system needs to build a pattern over a period of few months.

Our inference from the discussion is simple. Technology should be an enabler for recruiters to get to the best fit and not as a roadblock. We suggest that you only use technology to create a long list of potential candidates. There should still be a human recruiter who screens the resume and speaks to the candidate to understand the aspirations and inclinations of a candidate.

In a candidate centric market as India, small and mid-sized businesses need contributors who will wear multiple hats. This implies that you need smart people and smartness can hardly be evaluated by  an ATS.
