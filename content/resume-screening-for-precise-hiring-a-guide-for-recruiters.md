Did you know that for every job opening, recruiters receive an average of 250 resumes? There are a ton of resumes to review!

With so many candidates vying for the same position, it is crucial for recruiters to have a precise and effective method for screening resumes. After all, research shows that recruiters spend just six seconds initially reviewing each resume. But here is the catch: even though so many people apply, up to 75% of qualified candidates are eliminated during this initial screening stage.

_So, how can [recruiters](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/7-effective-diversity-recruiting-strategies-for-recruiters/) ensure they are picking the right candidates?_

That is where the precision resume screening process comes in.

In this blog, we will highlight the resume screening practices for precision hiring that will help recruiters identify the top talent efficiently.

## **What is Resume Screening?**

[Resume Screening](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/best-resume-shortlisting-practices-for-hr-professionals/) is the initial and one of the most important hiring process steps. It involves reviewing job applicants' resumes by recruiters and hiring managers to assess their suitability for a particular role. The decision of whether the applicant is qualified is based on relevant information like education, experience, certification, and skills.

An effective screening process helps you find the perfect fit for the organisation. The primary goal of resume screening is to shortlist candidates who have the potential to succeed in the role and advance to the next stage of the hiring process, such as interviews.

By implementing a thorough screening process, recruiters can accomplish their objective of selecting the most skilled and suitable candidate, while also adding a dependable new member to their team.

## **Resume Screening Practices for Precision Hiring**

Accurate resume screening is crucial for identifying the best candidates for [job openings](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/creative-ways-promote-company-job-opening-2024/). Here are five best practices to ensure precision and effectiveness in the resume screening process:

### Define Clear Job Requirements

Effective resume screening begins with the formulation of specific criteria. Before commencing the method, establish exact parameters based on the criteria and [job description](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-to-write-inclusive-job-descriptions/). This ensures that all candidates will be evaluated consistently and using the same criteria. Having well-defined criteria simplifies the screening process and helps recruiters focus on the most important talents and attributes for the role. Â In addition, this level of transparency ensures that recruiters and stakeholders are in complete agreement when it comes to selecting candidates. It also simplifies communication with hiring managers, making the process much smoother. By establishing clear criteria from the start, recruiters can effectively identify candidates who are the perfect match for the role and the company.

### Develop Screening Criteria

Based on the defined job requirements, establish specific screening criteria to evaluate resumes effectively. Consider educational background, years of experience, technological skills, certifications, and any other relevant credentials. Having set criteria allows recruiters to objectively assess candidates' suitability for the post.

### Utilize Technology

Use [applicant tracking systems (ATS](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/recruiters-guide-applicant-tracking-system-ats/)) and other recruitment tools to speed up the resume screening process. These tools automate resume processing, keyword matching, and applicant rating, making it simpler to manage large numbers of resumes. ATS platforms also facilitate collaboration among hiring team members and ensure that screening criteria are consistently applied.

### Implement Blind Screening Techniques

If you want to ensure a fair screening process and minimize [unconscious biases](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-to-tackle-unconscious-bias-in-the-workplace/), it is worth considering the implementation of blind screening techniques. It is important to remember to remove any personally identifiable information, such as names, gender, age, and photos, from resumes before they are evaluated. By evaluating candidates solely on their qualifications and merits, we can ensure a fair and unbiased assessment, free from any influence of demographic factors.

### Conduct Structured Reviews

Create a systematic method for reviewing resumes to ensure consistency and precision. Create scoring checklists that are based on predefined screening criteria to evaluate resumes systematically. Give each criterion a specific weight based on how crucial it is for the role. By evaluating all resumes using consistent standards, we can reduce bias and improve the reliability of hiring choices.
