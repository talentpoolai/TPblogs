> _We are excited to introduce you to the newly-designed brand image of Talentpool!_

Recruitment has evolved a lot from the time we started our journey back in 2006. From being just software that helps you leverage your database of candidates, Talentpool has now become a software that helps you hire better to gain long-term competitive advantages.

Large enterprise companies use Talentpool to streamline their recruitment. The software helps teams join various pieces of the recruiting puzzle such as multiple sources, parallel workflows, mobile devices, and ever-changing recruitment priorities. Talentpool, as a product, has evolved and it is time that the brand image reflected the same.

Presenting our brand new logo that explains the essence of what Talentpool helps recruitment teams achieve:

The arrow from “**A**” to “**E**” stands for the process of converting an **applicant** into an **employee**. It also stands for the progress, precision, and speed that Talentpool brings to the table. The combination of black and green, black being the neutral color that helps the can we think of something else for blackout and Green symbolizing freshness and growth to give that new look and feel.
