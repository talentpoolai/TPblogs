Before hiring international talent, you need to conduct geographic research. Find out about the recruitment and educational structure of the target country. For example, some nations might be more tech-oriented than others. You can choose a country that has an education system compatible with the skills needed in your organization.

By conducting geographic research, you can also get to know about the time zone differences. It may be the case that during your organization's working hours, they are off in the prospective employee's country. This is why identifying time zone challenges and addressing them with the candidate during recruitment is essential. It will help you determine whether the candidate is comfortable with the occupational hours or not.

## **2\. Harness the Power of Hiring Channels**

There's no compulsion that you need to visit a foreign country in order to recruit candidates from there. You can use a reliable remote hiring digital channel to recruit international talent. You can also outsource international hiring to a reliable third-party with a worldwide network.

You can use job-sharing digital channels to kickstart the international hiring process. Social media sites like LinkedIn and Twitter can help you recruit global talent. By leveraging the power of hiring channels, you can also slash recruitment costs.

Not all candidates search for a job role actively. For example, many passive candidates not applying for an open job role do possess the skills needed for the job. Passive candidates are usually already recruited by some other employer. However, it has been observed that passive candidates search for job opportunities on several freelancing websites/platforms. You can use such freelancing websites to enhance your international [recruitment process](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/slow-recruitment-process/).

You need to be aware of all the compliance requirements beforehand in order to conduct international hiring smoothly. Failing to meet compliance requirements can result in legal hassles and loss of business reputation.

Recruiters also need to understand the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) rules of the target country before hiring international talent. According to GDPR, you can only collect candidate data related to the job offer. Recruiters must also safeguard the sensitive data of foreign candidates.

## **4\. Understand the Cultural Differences**

Every country has its unique culture, and a recruiter has to respect that. You need to know about the cultural practices of the target country and notice how they are different from yours. Before hiring international talent, you can obtain information about cultural aspects like social standards, beliefs, fashion, and language. If there are any language barriers, you need to be aware of them beforehand.

## **5\. Understand the Remuneration Part**

The minimum employment charge differs from one nation to another. You need to know about the basic remuneration policies before hiring international talent. It'll help you analyze the salary expectations of foreign candidates.

Before you hire international recruits, you need to understand their salary expectations. The salary expectations can differ significantly from one country to another. Besides the remuneration aspect, many other employment laws also differ from one country to another. 

## **6\. Decide the Recruitment Workflow**

Before hiring international talent, divide your recruitment process into several steps. To avoid last-minute hassles, it's better to pre-decide the hiring workflow for international recruitment. Plan the process of posting jobs, shortlisting resumes, conducting interviews and written exams (if any), and onboarding beforehand for better results.
