### **Step 2: Collect the Candidates’ Information**

Typically, that includes basic contact information like name, address, phone number, education details, employment details, etc. It may also include other data to verify a candidate’s identity, like their date of birth. However, avoid gathering any information that could lead to discrimination, like race, color, religion, sex, gender, national origin, disability, etc.

### **Step 3: Run a Background Check**

Next, you can conduct employee background checks depending on your industry, and open positions while complying with state laws.

For example, suppose you want to hire a candidate for a finance-related position. In this case, you might want to check the candidate’s employment history, educational details, and credit reports.

### **Step 5: Make the Hiring Decision**

Once you have access to the background check materials, review them to see if your candidate is qualified to work for your organization. If you don't feel at ease based on the information you've gathered, move on to other prospects who may better reflect your organization.
