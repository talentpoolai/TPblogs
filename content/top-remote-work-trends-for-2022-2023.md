These features help recruiters, project managers, and decision-makers work in sync remotely, thereby increasing hiring productivity.

During this time, both employers and employees realized the benefits that come with this model. Gradually, it became the preferred method of working for many members of the workforce.

_**Indeed, it is estimated that by the end of this year, 25% of all open positions will be remote, with the figure expected to rise even further by 2023. Work-from-home rates have more than tripled from 4% to 15% since the pandemic began.**_

Remote work software, such as mobile work tools and virtual reality conferencing, is predicted to become the preferred mode of communication in the future, even surpassing face-to-face meetings. AI will also likely play a major role in managing remote staff.

These advancements might put organizations more at ease. The transition to managing a remote workforce might be scary, but with the right technology and strategy in place, it can be a seamless process.
