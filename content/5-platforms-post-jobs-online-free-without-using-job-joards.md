Creating a specific career page can help candidates to get complete information on available job positions.

This helps candidates to get updated every time when there is new position is created.

## **Use Classified Websites**

These websites are customized so that candidates can search for specific job openings. One can also publish advertisements on classified websites to promote job openings at an affordable rate.
