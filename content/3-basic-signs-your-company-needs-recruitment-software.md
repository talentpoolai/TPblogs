Efficient recruitment is a result of a flawless hiring timeline and ideal hiring processes. While uncertainties are not in the hands of the company, better recruitment processes certainly are and can help the business find the best talent.

Based on a LinkedIn Survey from 2019, 42% of managers constantly worry about their inability to find the perfect talent.

Recruiting software can help make this process effortless. These [recruiting tools](https://www.thetalentpool.ai) assist with planning, organizing, and streamlining the hiring pipeline. They save costs and reduce the hiring time, which helps the company in the recruiting stages. 

Running a hiring audit on the existing system can help you determine the ideal tool for your needs.

## **3 Signs Your Company Needs Recruitment Software**

Here are some tell-tale signs that your business might require recruitment software:

### **1\. Clear Lack of Automation**  

Gone are the days of a traditional way of hiring approach. Machines today are more intelligent and faster which helps to speed up any task. They do not replace the need for humans but merely help make their jobs easier and quicker. 

Research on Linkedin shows that 67% of recruiters or hiring managers admitted that artificial intelligence tools save their time. Manual entries, inputs to job portals, or interview scheduling cannot remain people-depended processes. Apart from being slow, they also increase the odds of human error.

Human bias is another reason that stalls many recruiting processes. Biases towards certain types of people or sections of society or favoritism toward known candidates can result in a lack of diversity or missing out on the most suitable candidates.

When asked by a wide range of hiring executives, 80% of them believed that automation tools improve the productivity and performance of the whole team. Lack of automation can also lead to the following issues: 

- **Higher cost of hiring** - When hiring is conducted without a system that cannot give the best outcomes, the process accounts for a higher price. 
- **Increased ‘time to fill.**’ ‘Time to fill’ is the measure of time between a job posting being listed and the offer being signed. This time must remain as short as possible to ensure profits for the company.
- **Lower productivity** from recruiters as simple tasks take longer.

To best integrate the automation system into your hiring process, start by finding areas in the hiring pipeline, and understanding how automation can help.

Using the right [recruiting software](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/3-basic-signs-your-company-needs-recruitment-software/) can make all the difference, so determine which areas can improve with automation. It also helps to designate a single person or department to manage these processes.

### **2\. Remain Highly Dependent on Job Boards** 

Hiring can sometimes be a paradox for businesses. There is a good chance that the outstanding talent may already have jobs during your hiring window. The lack of skilled and high-quality candidates is the most significant challenge, according to 67% of recruiters. It's thus necessary to use more than one source when hiring.

Job boards are a time-consuming approach for screening candidates. More than one area must be employed for better range and results. Some recruiting software helps compile data from multiple job boards, hiring websites, social media listings, etc. 

Manually sourcing resumes from various destinations can also make the system tedious. Additionally, social media job postings and job advertising take time to master and gain results. This friction is reducible by using recruiting software. 

The lack of a recruiting tool also reduces collaboration between the people in the team. Recruiting software works as a single-point dashboard for all the people involved in hiring, and this unified collaboration approach also reduces communication gaps.   

In addition, using an ATS or applicant tracking system can streamline your entries and is proven to reduce 80% of your resume screening time. This further emphasizes the use of a recruiting tool or an agency to make the process faster. 

### 3\. Not Enough Data and Metrics to Improve Hiring

Data is the backbone for the betterment of any process. Without knowing the current status of a process, there is no way to make changes and gauge better efficiently.

In recruitment, metrics such as ‘quality of hire,’ ‘interview to hire ratio,’ ‘offer acceptance rate,’ etc., all help the company take a data-driven approach to better their recruitment process.

The tracking of such data becomes effortless when using recruitment software. It checks all the data points in the hiring process and remains readily available to run simulations and analyses—the more manual work in the hiring process, the lower the quality of automated and accurate metrics.  

Recruiting tools have industry-standard data to compare and contrast your standing in the competitive market. Most RS also provides a well-designed representation of the recruiting data for sharing and collaboration. 

## In Closing

The use of recruiting tools only makes hiring faster and more efficient, reducing costs to the company. Additionally, using conventional ways of hiring will make your company unpopular and place you at a disadvantage in the competitive market.

Besides, today’s tools are elementary to use, need minimal training, and the providers always offer support for a seamless experience.
