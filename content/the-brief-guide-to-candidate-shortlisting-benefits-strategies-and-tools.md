You have put up a new [job posting](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/our-2023-job-board-quick-guide-where-should-you-post/), and the applications are pouring in. You are receiving many strong candidates and are thrilled about your possibilities.

However, sifting through the pile of applicants can quickly feel overwhelming.

How will you select the right candidates to focus on? Which candidates will you call for an interview?

That is where candidate shortlisting comes into play. It enables hiring teams to focus on the most promising candidates.

In this article, we will explore what candidate shortlisting is and why it is so important. Then, we will show you how to do proper shortlisting. We will also introduce you to various tools that make it easy, systematic, and risk-free.

## **What Is Candidate Shortlisting?**

Candidate shortlisting is the process of reviewing a pool of applicants for a job or position. It involves selecting a smaller group of candidates who are deemed most qualified for further consideration. It is typically carried out by recruiters or hiring managers as part of the [initial screening process.](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/pre-employment-screening-everything-you-need-know/)

During candidate shortlisting, the resumes, applications, and CVs of potential candidates are reviewed to determine their suitability for the role. The goal is to identify individuals with the necessary qualifications, skills, and experience that align with the job requirements.

The purpose of candidate shortlisting is to narrow down the applicant pool to a manageable number of highly qualified candidates. It helps streamline the [recruitment process](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-to-improve-your-existing-talent-sourcing-strategy/). This saves time and resources by focusing on those individuals who have the greatest potential to succeed in the role.

## **Why Is Shortlisting Important?**

Candidate shortlisting is a crucial step in the [recruitment process](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/10-ways-boost-candidate-engagement-in-recruitment-rocess/) as it helps employers identify the most promising candidates efficiently. It ensures that only the most qualified individuals progress to the subsequent stages, saving time and resources.

One of the major advantages of candidate shortlisting is that it saves valuable time and resources for hiring teams.

**_According to a study by Glassdoor, the average time-to-hire is 23.8 days_**. Shortlisting helps streamline this timeline by narrowing down the applicant pool. It allows [recruiters](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/7-time-saving-hacks-for-recruiters/) to focus their efforts on evaluating the most promising candidates.

Shortlisting also enhances the [quality of hires](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/6-ways-maintain-hiring-quality-volume-hiring/). **_According to an Aberdeen Group study, organisations with effective shortlisting processes witnessed a 36% year-over-year improvement in hiring quality_**. By assessing candidates against job requirements, organisations can find candidates who are suited to the role.

In a nutshell, shortlisting ensures a fair and objective selection process. By establishing clear screening criteria and following a standardised evaluation approach, organisations can minimize biases. It also helps promote equal opportunities for all applicants. This fosters a [diverse and inclusive workforce.](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/5-steps-include-diversity-in-hiring/)

## **What are the Basic Principles of Shortlisting in Recruitment?**

Following the essential principles of shortlisting ensures that the shortlisted candidates are highly qualified and align with the requirements of the job. This helps in identifying the most suitable individuals for further evaluation and consideration in the recruitment process.

### 1\. **Alignment with Job Requirements**

The shortlisted candidates should closely match the job requirements specified in the [job description.](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-to-write-inclusive-job-descriptions/) Evaluate their qualifications, skills, and experience to ensure they possess the necessary competencies and knowledge to perform the role effectively. Look for a strong fit in terms of education, relevant work experience, and any other criteria outlined in the job description.

### 2\. **Objective Evaluation**

Ensure a fair and objective evaluation of candidates by using standardised criteria and assessment methods. Develop clear screening criteria and apply them consistently to all candidates. Avoid personal [biases](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-to-tackle-unconscious-bias-in-the-workplace/) or subjective judgments in the shortlisting process. Evaluate candidates based on objective factors such as qualifications, experience, skills, and achievements.

### 3\. **Selective Approach**

Shortlisting is about selecting the best candidates from the applicant pool, not just eliminating unsuitable candidates. Use a selective approach to increase the probability of meeting potential employees. The key is to build the funnel with a balance between quality and quantity. Aim for a manageable number of candidates who have the potential to succeed in the position. Rather than including many candidates who do not meet the key criteria.

## **How to Build a Solid Shortlisting Process?**

So, now that you know why shortlisting is essential, it is time to see how it is done.

### 1\. **Define Job Requirements**

Begin by clearly defining the job requirements and qualifications. This includes identifying the necessary skills, experience, educational background, certifications, and any other specific criteria relevant to the position. Consult with relevant stakeholders, such as hiring managers or department heads, to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the role. Recruiters can collaborate with hiring managers and ask questions so that they can build the ideal candidate persona. If it is a replacement, recruiters should ask how different a candidate they would like to process this time.

### 2\. **Establish Screening Criteria**

Develop objective screening criteria that align with the job re quirements. These criteria should be measurable and directly related to the candidate's ability to perform the job successfully. Document these criteria to ensure consistency in the shortlisting process. This initial screening helps narrow down the applicant pool to a more manageable number.

### 3\. **Decide on the Length of the Shortlist**

While it is not essential to stick to it, it is useful to have a rough idea of how many candidates you want to progress. Looking at your past application-interview-job offer ratio is a good place to start.

You can also follow the average benchmark of 12%. It means that 12 out of every 100 applicants will make it onto your shortlist.

Whatever figure you choose, do not put unqualified candidates through it just to meet it. Also, do not eliminate a strong prospect because they exceed your quota. Be flexible and pick those candidates who have consistently impressed throughout the screening.

### 4\. **Objective Assessment Method**

Candidate assessments usually come later in the recruitment process. But adding them early on can help you get to know your applicants better in the beginning. Especially when you are expecting [high volumes of applicants](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/what-is-high-volume-hiring-top-strategies-to-survive-high-volume-hiring/).

Assessments also come in handy if there is a specific skill you need to score applicants for. For example, suppose your must-have criteria are very specific. An assessment can help you understand who really has those skills versus who just lists them on their [resume.](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/candidate-database-management/)

This could include reviewing work samples, assessing technical skills through tests or assignments, or evaluating written responses to specific questions. Ensure that the assessment methods are aligned with the job requirements and allow for an objective evaluation of candidates.

### 5\. **Score or Rank Candidates**

Develop a scoring or ranking system to evaluate candidates based on the established criteria. Assign scores or rankings to candidates based on their qualifications, skills, and performance in the assessment methods used. This helps in comparing candidates objectively and identifying the top performers.

One way to implement this is by using a scoring system with a small table example. Let us consider a hypothetical scenario where we evaluate candidates based on three criteria: experience, technical skills, and communication skills. We assign a maximum score of 5 for each criterion, with a higher score indicating stronger proficiency.

Based on the ranking derived from the total scores, one can make informed decisions regarding the shortlisting process. In this case, Candidate C may be considered a top candidate due to their overall high score.

| **Candidate** | **Experience** | **Technical Skills** | **Communication Skills** | **Total Score** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Candidate A** | 4 | 3 | 5 | 12 |
| **Candidate B** | 3 | 4 | 4 | 11 |
| **Candidate C** | 5 | 5 | 3 | 13 |
| **Candidate D** | 2 | 3 | 5 | 10 |
| **Candidate E** | 4 | 2 | 4 | 10 |

Based on the ranking derived from the total scores, one can make informed decisions regarding the shortlisting process. In this case, Candidate C may be considered a top candidate due to their overall high score.

### 6\. **Document and Communicate**

Document the rationale behind the selection of candidates for the shortlist. It includes the specific reasons why certain applicants were chosen and others were not. This documentation helps maintain transparency and serves as a reference for future stages of the recruitment process. Communicate the shortlist to the relevant stakeholders, such as hiring managers or interview panel members. It provides them with the necessary information to proceed with the next evaluation steps.

## **Innovative Shortlisting Tools You Need to Try**

If you want to improve the way you shortlist candidates, you should take advantage of the power of recruitment tools. Fortunately, there are numerous excellent techniques available to assist you in separating quality prospects from others.

Here are three useful shortlisting tools that can enhance the candidate shortlisting process:

### 1\. **AI-Powered Resume Screening Tools**

[AI-powered resume screening tools](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-integrated-technology-can-improve-your-recruitment-process/) utilize natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algo rithms to analyse and evaluate resumes. These tools can quickly scan resumes for relevant keywords, skills, and qualifications, allowing recruiters to identify [top candidates](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/top-reasons-why-you-are-losing-top-talent-to-competitors/) efficiently. They help eliminate manual resume screening, reduce bias, and streamline the shortlisting process.

### 2\. **Gamified Assessments**

Gamified assessments present candidates with interactive and engaging challenges that simulate real-work scenarios. These assessments assess candidates' skills, problem-solving abilities, and decision-making skills in a fun and immersive way. Gamified assessments provide a unique and enjoyable candidate experience. They also evaluate candidates' competencies in a more dynamic and authentic manner.

### 3\. **Video-based Soft Skills Assessment**

Traditional interviews may not always reveal candidates' soft skills effectively. Video-based soft skills assessments provide a more comprehensive evaluation of candidates' non-technical abilities, such as communication, leadership, and emotional intelligence. These tools enable candidates to respond to video prompts or scenarios. Their responses are analysed using AI algorithms to assess their proficiency in soft skills.

### **Difference Between Screening and Candidate Shortlisting**

While screening and shortlisting are closely related and often overlap in practice, they represent different stages within the recruitment process. Screening is typically the initial step to filter out unqualified candidates. Whereas candidate shortlisting involves a more comprehensive evaluation to identify the best-fit individuals for the job.

## **Conclusion**

In summary, to successfully shortlist candidates you should not take on the entire task in one go. Follow the processes outlined above for a more efficient and productive [recruitment process.](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/11-ways-recruitment-automation-reshape-recruiting-process/)
