Considering the diverse skills required for modern-day jobs, recruitment isn’t easy. As a result, recruiters need a helping hand for the seamless integration of recruitment processes.

An ATS (Applicant Tracking System) can help recruiters flawlessly integrate hiring processes. Read on to know the uses, benefits, and features of applicant tracking systems in 2022.

## **Understanding Applicant Tracking Systems**

An applicant tracking system can enable the electronic handling of recruitment processes. With the aid of such a software application, firms can centrally control different recruitment processes.

For example, for a particular job opening, recruiters have to shortlist candidates based on their resumes. Recruiters also have to store the results of each applicant after every recruitment round. Also, there is a need to maintain clear communication to enhance the applicant experience. Managing all these recruitment processes manually is a challenge for recruiters in 2022.

With applicant tracking systems, recruiters can view the progress of recruitment processes under a single dashboard. HRs, management officials, and business owners can screen and hire employees easily with applicant tracking systems.

Any mundane tasks associated with recruitment can be completed easily with applicant tracking systems. With the aid of AI/ML, ATS can now automate repetitive tasks associated with recruitment for businesses.

From advertising job postings to interview management, everything can be organized and completed with ATS.

## **The Workings of an ATS**

The workings of an ATS will depend on the specific recruitment process. For example, many businesses use an ATS for shortlisting candidates for a specific post based on their resumes. The ATS takes all the resumes and matches them against the job description.

Consider a job opening that invites an applicant from a CSE background. If applicants from a commerce background apply for the job opening, the ATS will reject those resumes. Similarly, an ATS can filter resumes based on skills, experience, or any other pre-decided factor. It does so by looking for specific keywords in the applicant resumes.

Modern-day applicant tracking systems also come with a chat function. Hiring teams can chat in real-time with each other with the ATS. Decisions can be taken from a central point with collaborative efforts. Many recruiters use an applicant tracking system to add commentary for each applicant.

Not to forget, an ATS can also help you with applicant communication and job posting. An ATS is a type of application software programmed to integrate different hiring processes. Modern-day [applicant tracking systems](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/are-you-getting-rejected-by-the-applicant-tracking-software/) run on AI/ML algorithms.

With modern-day ATS, recruiters can make informed decisions in real-time. The ATS creates a recruitment funnel that is easy to be followed. An example of a recruitment funnel created by an ATS for a job opening is as follows:
