As the job market becomes more and more talent-driven, speed and efficiency can make or break your recruitment outcomes. Modern recruiters are not just looking for more resumes but looking for better tools to move faster, collaborate smarter, and reduce dependency on external teams or systems. 

That is why we are excited to announce two powerful updates in Talentpool’s [recruitment software](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/) this June. These new capabilities are designed to help your team hire faster, collaborate better, and manage the recruitment pipeline seamlessly without extra IT help, third-party vendor dependency, or complex workarounds. 

Let’s explore what is new! 

## **Launch Your Career Page in a Day** 

Every great candidate journey begins with a great first impression: your career page. 

A branded career page does not just look professional, but also boosts conversion rates and attracts high-quality applicants who resonate with your culture. And yet, creating or updating a career page is often delayed by back-and-forth with IT teams, branding approvals, or the need to coordinate with third-party vendors. Not anymore.  

By integrating this capability into the recruitment software, you can cut delays and build better [candidate experiences](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/creating-positive-candidate-experience-actionable-tips/) right from the start. 

### **What’s New:** 

Talentpool’s latest update empowers recruitment teams to build, customize, and launch branded career pages, all within the platform. 

With a few simple clicks, you can: 

- Upload your company logo 

- Set your brand colors 

- Customize fields based on job categories, departments, and geographies 

- Add unique messaging or video banners to reflect your EVP 

- Go live within a single day 

No need to go after internal IT teams. No waiting weeks for deployment. 

## **Simplify Assessments with MeritTrac Integration** 

Pre-employment assessments are a critical part of identifying top talent, but struggling between platforms can slow things down. 

Switching between assessment tools and [applicant tracking systems](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/7-common-mistakes-to-avoid-when-using-applicant-tracking-system-ats-software/) (ATS) not only consumes time but also leads to data silos and communication gaps. With this new feature, recruiters and hiring managers can streamline candidate evaluation without losing context or momentum. 

### **What’s New:** 

With our MeritTrac integration, Talentpool users can now: 

- Assign assessments directly from the candidate profile 

- Track status and scores in real-time 

- Send reminders or schedule tests without leaving the platform 

This integration means that your [recruitment management system](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/want-to-hire-smarter-and-faster-a-recruitment-management-system-is-the-answer/) is now even more powerful - bridging the gap between sourcing and screening. It reduces turnaround time by day and ensures smarter, data-backed shortlisting. 

## **How These Updates Improve Your End-to-End Hiring Workflow?** 

**1\. Faster Go-to-Market for Job Openings** 

With a career page you can build instantly, your jobs can go live faster. No dependencies, no design backlogs. 

**2\. Improved Candidate Quality** 

Integrating assessments helps filter out mismatched profiles early, so your interview panel only sees pre-qualified, skill-ready candidates. 

**3\. Time and Resource Optimization** 

Both features reduce the back-and-forth involved in hiring. Whether it’s avoiding IT handoffs or eliminating tool-switching, the updates empower recruiters to focus on hiring, not administration. 

## **Built for the Modern TA Team** 

Talentpool’s recruitment software has always focused on one thing: helping recruiters, hiring managers, and HR leaders work smarter together. With our recent innovations in automation, resume parsing, AI recommendations, and now career page building and assessment integration, we are continuing to evolve into a full-fledged recruitment management system. 

## **Final Thoughts: What This Means for You** 

Recruitment is evolving and so should your tools. With Talentpool’s June 2025 product updates, you are not just filling jobs faster, but you are creating a better, more streamlined hiring experience for candidates and teams alike. 

## **Ready to Experience It?**
