## What is Test Management?

While working under the pressure of limited time and limited resources, reusing test artifacts within a project or across a project can improve the efficiency of the testing team. Not only those artifacts that are used in test automation can be reused but also test procedures and planning information can be reused. An effective test management process involves creating test artifacts in such a way that they can be reused easily. Testing iteratively helps to generate testing artifacts and results early on in the project lifecycle. For effective test management, it is recommended to organize the various test artifacts and resources for iterations. This facilitates planning for the changes, delays and unforeseen events effectively.
