If there is one priority that every boardroom is discussing today, it is to hire a talented workforce.

Recruiters are up against a challenge they have not seen in the last couple of years. In this scenario, where the existing staff is resigning, and the business is demanding new hires as of yesterday, recruiters are rethinking their strategies.

One aspect that can make a considerable difference is **candidate engagement.** Several times, candidates drop out in the middle of the [hiring process](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/), leaving the recruiters in a trouble. It not only wastes effort and time but also creates a negative impression on the business teams. 

**Candidate engagement strategies** ensure there is constant communication with the applicants to keep them warm. Moreover, it enables recruiters to detect early warning signs and take appropriate action.

The biggest advantage is that it leaves a lasting impression on the applicants, whether they join you or not.

## 10 Ways to Boost Candidate Engagement in the Recruitment Process

### **1\. A Simple Job Application Process**

An effective **[candidate engagement](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/6-ways-increase-employee-engagement/)** strategy takes care of the candidates right from the beginning. A lengthy job application process can put them off and even cause them to drop out, even before entering your hiring funnel.

### 2\. Respond Faster

At times, recruiters take days to review the application and convey if the applicant is qualified for the role or not. Candidates may lose interest if they do not hear from you for days. The faster you respond, the higher your chances of onboarding the candidate.

Similarly, some recruiters do not contact the applicant after an interview simply because they are meeting other candidates for the role. While there is nothing wrong with that, if you do not communicate with the applicants, you may lose them to other job opportunities. 

Instead of picking up your phone and calling the applicants personally, you can automate this communication. You can select a hiring tool that sends frequent updates, such as texts and emails, to engage the candidates. 

### 3\. Explain the Recruitment Process

Every organization can have a different hiring process. For instance, some have only one interview round, while a few may have multiple interview rounds. When the applicants do not know what they are waiting for, they will lose interest soon. 

If you are looking to **improve candidate engagement**, make it a point to communicate the hiring process at the beginning. The candidates will know what to expect and prepare accordingly.

### 4\. Offer Flexibility in Tests

Several organizations have started using pre-screening tests to identify the best candidates for their organizations. However, you may lose qualified applicants if these tests have rigid timelines or environments.

For instance, calling them to your office or asking them to complete the test within a day can be unreasonable, given their demands at work.

The most effective **[candidate engagement tools](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/)** are the ones that allow the candidates the flexibility to take these pre-screening tests at their convenient time and location.

### 5\. Auto Interview Scheduling

Calling the candidates and setting up interviews is an inefficient process. It takes a lot of time for recruiters to manage the calendars of hiring managers and match them with the candidates.

Moreover, conveying any changes at the last minute is another hassle. There is a distinct possibility that you may miss out on doing so and ruin the candidate's hiring experience.

One of the most effective **candidates engagement practices** is to automate interview scheduling. It allows the hiring managers and candidates to schedule the interviews at their convenience. 

### 6\. Update Candidate Feedback

Most recruiters do not share feedback after screening tests and interviews. Perhaps you liked the candidate, but the role was filled internally. In another case, you found a better fit but would still like to meet this applicant for a future role.

When you do not share your feedback, candidates might not have a satisfying experience. They may become disinterested in exploring future roles simply because they get the impression that your organization does not share feedback.

### 7\. Give the Latest Updates on New Jobs

To **improve candidate engagement**, it is essential to communicate with candidates even when they are not looking for jobs actively. The idea is to connect with them and maintain a constant flow of communication.

One of the best ways to do this is by sharing your new vacancies. You can automate this process and send weekly or fortnightly emails to your candidate database. An added bonus is that this will reduce your sourcing efforts.

### 8\. Approach Candidates through Social Media

In this digital age, organizations need to have an active social media presence to engage candidates. What you post and how you communicate can help you convey your desired message.

For instance, you can use social profiles to portray yourself as a young organization or one that values innovation and creativity. You can also use them to develop your employer's brand and engage candidates.

### 9\. Use Chatbots to Answer Queries

Several applicants struggle to find information about companies. They may have questions about your company culture, work-life balance, or salary that they may be uncomfortable asking you. Moreover, you may not have the time to answer all their questions.

Chatbots can manage this for you and answer candidates' questions satisfactorily. This can **improve candidate engagement**, and applicants may be keen to join you.  

### 10\. Talk About the Company's Culture

As important as it is for you to find the perfect role and organization fit, it is equally vital for the candidates to work at a company that matches their values and beliefs. Thus, discussing your company culture in the hiring process is essential.

Apart from engaging the candidates, it can also help you hire candidates who truly understand your culture and requirements.

## In Summary

Candidate engagement has become all the more crucial in today's time when organizations are fighting to hire and onboard talent.

With the **effective candidate engagement practices** mentioned above, you can now keep them interested throughout the hiring process and ensure they accept your offer.
