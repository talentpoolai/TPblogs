**What’s New in Talentpool? July 2025 Feature Updates**

Recruiters don’t need more tools. They need a simplified, clutter-free system that channelizes their workflow in a better way.

If you've ever waited three days for feedback from a panelist, struggled with multiple tabs just to check how a job looks on your careers page, or had to escalate to IT for something as simple as deactivating a user, this update is for you.

Talentpool [Recruitment Software](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/)’s July 2025 release focuses on removing the blockers that silently slow down enterprise hiring. Let’s walk you through what’s new and how they can help you streamline your workflow.

**Total Access Control with SSO Integration**

Enterprise recruitment doesn't just demand speed, but also demands security and scalability. With our new Single Sign-On (SSO) integration, Talentpool now allows you to connect directly with your organization’s identity provider. That means no longer managing usernames and passwords within your [applicant tracking software](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/choosing-the-right-ats-key-features-to-look-for-in-2025) (ATS). IT can now centrally control who gets access, revoke it instantly when needed, and ensure everyone logs in securely through your existing identity provider.

For recruiters, it's a one-click login. For IT teams, it's a fully compliant, enterprise-ready setup. But most importantly, for your organization, it’s a major security upgrade.

**Here’s why:**

- **No more weak or reused passwords:** SSO eliminates the need for separate Talentpool credentials, which reduces the risk of compromised accounts due to password reuse across tools.
- **Faster deactivation:** When someone leaves your company or changes roles, access to Talentpool is instantly revoked through your identity provider without manual follow-ups.
- **Stronger authentication protocols:** SSO systems often include multi-factor authentication (MFA) and login monitoring, offering an extra layer of protection that most standalone logins can’t provide.

So, while recruiters get a smoother experience, your IT team gets exactly what they need: better control, fewer endpoints to monitor, and significantly reduced risk.

**Step-Wise Feedback Downloads for Every Interview Round**

Recruiters and hiring managers often struggle with inconsistent interview feedback spread across emails, notes, or spreadsheets. Talentpool solves this by allowing detailed feedback downloads per interview round, available in just a few clicks.

- **Complete visibility into candidate evaluations:** Whether you’re reviewing a single candidate or comparing across rounds, you get a clear view of how each person was assessed. No more back-and-forth between interviewers to collect fragmented inputs.
- **Better collaboration and faster decisions:** Hiring managers and panels can review structured feedback side by side, ensuring decisions are objective, aligned, and quick.
- **Easy documentation and audit readiness:** For organizations with rigorous audit or compliance processes, storing structured interview feedback is critical. With stepwise feedback downloads, you can now ensure every stage of your hiring process is well-documented and transparent.

**Workflow and UX Enhancements That Save Time**

One of the biggest [recruitment challenges](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/overcoming-recruitment-challenges-in-india-a-technology-driven-approach) is to bring both speed and clarity into the process. That’s why our July 2025 update also includes workflow improvements and UX refinements to simplify everyday tasks within the Talentpool dashboard.

- **Live Career Site Preview from the HR Dashboard:** You can now view how job listings appear on your external career site without switching tabs or opening another browser window. This ensures accuracy before you hit the publish button and gives recruiters more confidence in what candidates will see.
- **Quick Edit Access for Career Page Settings:** See something that needs a fix? Admins can now jump straight from the preview to career page settings, making real-time edits faster than ever.
- **Smarter Job Creation with Inline Additions:** While creating a new position, recruiters can now add skills, locations, and departments without switching modules. This helps speed up job creation, especially when handling diverse roles across multiple functions.
- **Instant Job URL Sharing:** Once you publish a job, the shareable URL is immediately available within the publish card. Whether you want to validate the listing or send it to your team, it’s now a one-click task.

Together, these updates contribute to a more intuitive recruitment experience through our applicant tracking software experience.

**Why These Updates Matter for Growing Recruitment Teams**

Manual work slows you down, disconnected systems introduce errors, and lack of visibility in the hiring funnel leads to poor decisions. With these July updates, Talentpool is pushing the boundary in what [modern hiring tools](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-modern-hiring-tools-make-finding-great-employees-easier) should do:

- Simplify secure access without burdening users
- Standardize and centralize interview evaluations
- Streamline every micro-task in the recruiter journey

When hiring velocity and quality are both critical, your applicant tracking software should work for you and not the other way around.

If you're upgrading your recruitment tech or exploring new recruitment software, now is the perfect time to see Talentpool in action.
