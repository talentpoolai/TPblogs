The success of an organisation largely depends on the people who run it. Promotions is a powerful strategy for motivating employees.

Employee promotion serves as a crucial milestone, symbolizing growth, recognition, and new opportunities. It is a moment when hard work and dedication are acknowledged, and individuals are entrusted with increased responsibilities. But promotion is not just a mere change in job title; it carries significant implications for both employees and organisations alike.

_**But how can you determine who deserves a promotion?**_

The decision to promote cannot be taken lightly. The art of promotion necessitates the careful evaluation of a variety of factors, ranging from performance to potential. Promotion establishes the recognition of employees’ hard work and dedication toward their job.

In this blog, we will highlight the types and importance of promoting employees. We will also look at different tactics you can use to promote employees.

## **What Is Employee Promotion?**

Employee promotion refers to the advancement of an employee to a higher position within an organisation. It is a process by which an individual is given increased responsibilities, authority, and possibly a higher salary or benefits package. Employee promotions are typically based on merit, performance, skills, experience, and potential.

Promotions can occur at the same job level. Here, an employee takes on additional responsibilities and becomes a senior member of their current team. They can also involve moving to a higher job level, like being promoted from a junior position to a managerial role.

## **Types of Employee Promotion**

Types of employee promotions may vary between organisations based on their structure, policies, and career development programs.

However, basically, there are three different types of employee promotions that can occur within an organisation.

### 1\. **Vertical Promotion**

Vertical promotions provide employees with more or different responsibilities, a higher salary, and a new job title. This is what most people envision when they consider promotions. Vertical promotions are an excellent way to reward high-performing employees and fill open jobs that might benefit from an internal perspective. They also communicate to your employees that the organisation values their professional [development.](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/importance-employee-development-modern-workplace/)

### 2\. **Horizontal Promotion**

Horizontal promotions entail an increase in salary and a new title, but the actual position remains the same. These promotions are effective in rewarding loyalty, recognizing new skills, and increasing retention. An example of horizontal promotion is when in universities, lecturers become senior lecturers after five to seven years.

### **‍3. Dry Promotion**

**Dry promotions** involve all the responsibility of a new title, but without the benefits that come with it. In other words, the company will ask more of the employee but will not provide compensation in return.

### 4\. **Open vs. Closed Promotion**

All of the above promotion types are classified as either open or closed employee promotions.

Open promotion refers to a promotion process that is transparent and accessible to all employees within an organisation. Here, the organisation communicates the promotion criteria, qualifications, and requirements to all employees. It allows them to actively participate and compete for promotion opportunities. The selection process is typically based on merit, performance, skills, experience, and potential.

On the other hand, closed promotion is a process where the promotion opportunities are limited to predetermined candidates. Here, the organisation may choose to promote employees based on subjective criteria or decisions made by management. However, the employers do not openly communicate the promotion process to all employees.
