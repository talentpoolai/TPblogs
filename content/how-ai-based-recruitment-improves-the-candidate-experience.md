According to a recent survey, 49% of job searchers refused job offers due to poor applicant experience. To effectively attract high-quality applicants, recruiters and HR teams must leave a positive impression on the candidates. 

The exponential rise of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in talent management provides significant potential for recruiters to maintain a cutting-edge applicant experience.

_Continue reading to understand how to improve the [candidate experience](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/actionable-tips-to-improve-candidate-experience/) with an AI-based recruitment platform._

## **Improved Personalization and Better Connect**

AI hiring software can analyze large amounts of data about each individual, including their employment history, talents, and preferences. Using this data, [AI-powered recruitment tools](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-ai-recruitment-software-is-transforming-hiring-a-practical-look-at-its-role-and-impact/) may adapt the entire employment process to the individual.

Instead of sending generic emails or job notifications, AI systems might suggest positions that closely fit a candidate's history and goals. They can also create interview questions or tests depending on the candidate's specific experiences. This level of personalization makes prospects feel that they are more than just another resume in the stack; they are seen, understood, and cherished.

## **Faster Response Times**

One of the most prevalent complaints for job seekers is the lengthy waiting time between applying and hearing back from a potential employer. Traditional [recruitment processes](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/comprehensive-insight-into-the-end-to-end-recruitment-process/) might take weeks, if not months, to determine a candidate's status.  At the same time, recruitment teams also get many profiles. In trying to wade through the majority of junk profiles through a manual process, it should not so happen that they miss engaging a good candidate. AI-based recruitment platform can help identify the best of the lot as well as help maintain communication that is regular and personalized.

AI screens and sorts applications relatively instantly. This implies that candidates get speedier feedback on whether they've advanced to the next level or not. Furthermore, AI-powered chatbots can interact with candidates in real time, answering questions, providing updates, and ensuring communication throughout the process. This prompt response not only keeps candidates informed but also convinces them that their application is being seriously reviewed.

In addition, AI hiring software strengthens communication by automating touchpoints across the hiring journey. With confirmation emails, interview reminders, and application status updates managed by AI, candidates remain informed and confident that their progress is being tracked. This eliminates the risk that recruiters might overlook top candidates due to the burden of sifting through irrelevant profiles.

## **Streamlined Application Process**

A lengthy, difficult application process may prevent qualified individuals from applying in the first place. AI streamlines this procedure, lowering friction for candidates. With AI hiring software, candidates can use chatbots or automated forms to guide them through the process and save hours spent filling out redundant or superfluous information.

The best hiring software can even pre-fill elements of an application using a candidate's submitted resume or LinkedIn profile. This saves the candidate time and effort, making the experience more enjoyable and stress-free. With fewer barriers in place, businesses may attract more eligible individuals who would otherwise be turned off by burdensome application systems.

## **Enhanced Assessments and Interviews**

AI hiring software also improves the assessment and interview stages of hiring. Traditional interviews are often subjective and based on the recruiter’s impressions, which can lead to inconsistencies in evaluation.

Using AI, candidates can be evaluated based on pre-defined criteria, and assessments can be tailored to match the specific job requirements. AI can analyze video interviews, for example, to assess body language, tone of voice, and even word choice to evaluate the candidate’s suitability for the role. This data-driven approach ensures that every candidate is evaluated fairly and accurately.

Furthermore, AI can [schedule interviews](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/interview-management-software/) based on the availability of both the recruiter and the candidate, reducing delays and making the process more convenient for all parties involved. Candidates no longer have to deal with endless back-and-forth scheduling, making the experience more seamless and enjoyable.

## **Instant Feedback**

Feedback is one of the most important considerations for candidates during the [hiring process](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-artificial-intelligence-changing-hiring-process/), but it is also often overlooked. AI-based recruitment allows candidates to receive real-time feedback after completing exams or interviews, giving them valuable insights into their performance.

This immediate feedback, whether favorable or constructive, can help applicants identify their strengths and areas for improvement. Even if they are not hired, prospects are more likely to have a positive impression of the organization if they receive timely and helpful feedback.

## **Conclusion**

In the future, it is anticipated that [AI hiring software](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/) will play a bigger role in enhancing the applicant’s experience. Predictive analytics and natural language processing, two emerging technologies, will offer ever-more-detailed insights into the preferences and behavior of candidates.

Hiring will include more than just finding the right candidates; it will also involve giving them an experience that leaves a positive impression, and AI will play a key role in making this shift possible.
