Oftentimes a recruiter faces a dilemma between two candidates given that both are efficient and have the same qualifications, relevant work experience. How does one know who the ideal candidate is? 

Additionally, there are candidates who might have exceptional qualifications as well as other credentials on the resume which bring a promise of value to the company. In such situations, assessment-based hiring can help validate the credentials of a candidate and get the right fit for a company.

Furthermore, based on a 2019 LinkedIn report, close to 57% of recruiting professionals prefer skills assessments since it saves time in shortlisting the right talent. Of these, 60% of evaluations have proven to create a drastic impact on the establishment. 

## Advantage of Assessment Methods to Hire

So, is this process of assessment-based [recruitment efficient](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/time-hire-all-recruiters-need-know-about-recruitment-metric/)? Here are some [advantages](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/recruitment-management-software-benefits/) to this approach.

- These assessments provide a hands-on display of their skills and legitimate proof of efficiency.

## 5 Assessment Methods For Any Company

Here are a few simple tests that one can use to help shortlist candidates, irrespective of the industry and job profile. 

### 1\. General Aptitude Test 

The GAT also called the intelligence test or cognitive abilities examination is one of the most commonly used methods. While qualification and work experience is easy to present and understand, the aptitude test allows recruiters to know more than just professional skills.

This test is typically a combination of numerical and verbal reasoning. Such programs test the candidate’s problem-solving skills in detail and help specific candidates stand out from the pact. The model is also unbiased as it’s not based on a prior formal-educational experience. 

These tests are back by millions for their scientifically proven results both in the short-term and the long run.  

### 2\. Job-Task Simulation 

A job-task simulation is a style of assessment-based hiring where the candidates must recreate a section of the actual work they might do with the company. This form of test is prevalent for tech-hiring. 

Some common examples are candidates asked to write a section of code, find a solution to a marketing problem, etc. The success of such an experiment boils down to determining the apt simulation challenge. The assessment must allow candidates to highlight their skills, stand out from the typical and challenge them to the best of their abilities. 

This hiring assessment also displays the real-time performance and experience of the candidate. For example, a coder who looks flustered during their inspection might also bring the same energy to the workplace. 

### 3\. Trial Jobs 

A trial job, unlike a simulation, is one where a candidate is given a more extended period (usually a week or month) to prove their worth to the establishment. This assessment functions as the ultimate test of their on-ground skills, as a probation period.

These kinds of trials are common among blue-collar jobs. The candidates are also remunerated for the month they dedicate to the company and assess their skills routinely.  

The only drawback is that it is unfavorable for many candidates to commit the time. Candidates would rather receive an assurance on their jobs before committing a month of their time.   

### 4\. Gamification of Work-Tasks 

Are you looking to make your hiring process the talk of the town? Well, gamification is the way forward. Make your hiring tasks fun while getting sufficient data to shortlist candidates in early-stage recruiting. 

These games typically showcase the candidates' personalities and stand out from the others in the group. One of the most common examples of this is the group-discussions sessions at college-level recruitment. The candidates have a healthy debate while still showcasing their skills, knowledge, and confidence. 

The same is also possible in online games, puzzles, quizzes, online forums, and much more. Some companies are also famous for asking their candidates to make videos to prove their worth to the company. However, such a format is not favorable for all industries.  

### 5\. Sample Works

And lastly, the most apparent and preferred mode of assessment-based hiring is a company asking for past work samples. In some cases, they are also invited to create a sample work based on a specific heading. Like in the case of hiring writers, the candidate must submit what the industry calls a copy-test.  

This is a perfect filtration process and allows the company to confirm if the candidate’s experience is genuine.  This method is also easier to execute and provides straightforward results. 

### In Closing, 

Today assessments in recruitment are widely used. Technology such as AI-Video calls is helping in screening and shortlisting of candidates. With so many options, you might have to make a choice for the right platform depending upon organizational priority.

Note that all of these methods might not be a fit for your company. Find one that fits your candidate pool, represents your company’s culture, and helps you genuinely find the right candidate.
