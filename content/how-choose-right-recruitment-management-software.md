An RMS or recruitment management software is a tool that enables a company or a recruiter to automate and streamline their hiring process. It also helps manage the complete end-to-end recruitment process, allowing companies to reduce recruiting time and keep the operations glitch-free. 

Interestingly enough, 86% of recruiters claim that using an RMS tool has helped them hire faster, which allows both small and large companies alike, irrespective of the size and position of hiring.

## Benefits of the Right Recruitment Management Software

Before we dive in further, here are some benefits of using the best recruiting software.

- Recruitment software provides a robust analytics feature, where real-time data tracking becomes possible. If any bottlenecks are found then it enables you to find discrepancies in the hiring process, calculate turn-out times, etc.
- A single dashboard helps organizations collaborate and communicate easily and streamlines the hiring processes. The applications can be easily moved right from sourcing, screening, feedback, interview, and till offer – all activities can be done on a single platform. 
- The traditional way of hiring takes ample time both in planning as well as in executing things. By removing this manual work from the system, the hiring process becomes fast and it directly reduces the cost of hiring significantly.
- Lastly, by using automation software human errors and biases can be avoided, and also avoid leaks in the talent pipeline. 

## How to Choose the Right Recruitment Management Software

Once you understand its efficiency, it's also critical to invest in a perfect tool for your business. Here are some tips and tricks to help you pick the right [recruitment management software](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/cloud-recruitment-software/). 

### What are the Recruitment Challenges? 

For starters, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to the recruitment management system. And to find the perfect tool, you would first need to understand your recruitment requirements.

Find out in which area your recruitment team is spending too much time. For example, if your team spends too much time on email follow-ups or wastes time in finding relevant candidates' applications. If analyzed carefully, this gives the right area to work on.

If more than one hiccup stalls your hiring process, your business could lack a streamlined workflow. Further, the lack of a data-driven approach indicates that the tool you choose must contain features like report building or career site analytics. 

### Highlight Changes That Can Help

With a general overview and the fundamental pain points detected, you must now highlight the critical features of any tool to help you recruit better.

Consider the example of email follow-ups above. Fixing this problem would require [recruitment management software](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/remote-working-collaboration-tools/) with list segmentation, reminder features, or email templates. 

Apart from the lack of talent scouting, many companies also lose good candidates to a leaky talent pipeline. Automation for interview scheduling and a single dashboard can help fix this issue. 

In the case of bulk hiring, managing multiple tasks is again challenging and can be easily maintained with the help of reliable recruitment software; a single action can help you group candidates and save time.

Each of these issues will need a different kind of tool or a tool that provides a combination of features. Planning will ensure that you do not invest in a feature you would never use.  

### Filter By Feature 

Next, pen down the features you would use the most. To help you further decide on these, we can break down the components of a recruitment management system into the following:

#### **Planning**

All recruitment starts with the planning stage. Some tools available in the market start from the roadmap stage of hiring. This step includes defining and approving the hiring process.

Using the tools, you can set up requisition approval workflows within the company and seek hiring approvals from the people in charge. The same immediately updates onto the device. 

#### Sourcing Talent

Most tools provide you with candidates' information who applied to a specific platform or gather multiple resumes from across the board. The most robust tools collect candidates from applications, job fairs, online portals, etc. 

These tools are pre-linked to agencies and consultants to help diversify options, and companies can also view the references of these candidates if any. 

#### **Engage and Communicate** 

The recruiter can then use the tool to engage with these candidates across channels. With the help of job alerts and notifications, they can thus attract the right talent. 

Individual emails and invitations are also an option on most tools. Using built-in templates and tools makes the process faster and more efficient. 

Collaboration between team heads and recruiters is also easier with a single dashboard. The interview process gets automated with calendar reminders, feedback prompts, etc.

Some apps also allow mobile access to ensure no delays or lags in communication. 

#### **Hire** 

With all the processes covered, feedback and negotiation are consolidated in a single place to close the hiring loop.

Making offers and managing communication at this stage is also more accessible with the right RMS. Many tools also provide robust analytics that help you enhance your hiring process and share reports with the whole team.

## Compare Costs and Reviews 

And lastly, pick a few tools that fit your needs and compare the costs. Some recruitment management systems charge you a monthly or yearly su bscription, while others work on a per-hire commission. Make your choice based on your requirements and volume.

Read reviews on websites and rating platforms to get a more wholesome idea about their functionality, customer support, and uses. Determine which recruitment software is used by industry leaders, backed by agencies, and has a better implementation time.

## In Closing

With all of this covered, you are ready to buy the best tool for your hiring needs. Never depend on a device purely for its cost; prioritize the features. Take calls with the customer support team if needed to get a better idea and clear doubts. 

Lastly, have the whole recruiting team on board with the idea before investing. Some of these tools take learning and experience, and not having the right person for the job could make your RMS inefficient.
