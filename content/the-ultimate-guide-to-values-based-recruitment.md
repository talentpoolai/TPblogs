### 4. Assess Candidates Based on their Values

Once you have identified candidates who share your values, it is important to assess them based on those values. This can be done through a values-based assessment. It is a series of questions designed to evaluate the candidate’s alignment with your company’s values.

In addition to a values-based assessment, you can also assess candidates based on their behavior during the [interview process](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/interview-management-software/). Look for signs that they are passionate about your company’s mission and values. You can also check if they have a track record of behavior that aligns with those values.
