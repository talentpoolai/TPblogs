Companies often indulge in recruitment drives to find the best talent. However, finding the top talent is not a cakewalk for HR professionals in 2022. The competition between companies has increased manifold.

Recruiters face many challenges, such as market fragmentation, poor candidate experience, ungovernable recruitment policies, etc. Inefficient [recruitment processes](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/how-to-improve-your-existing-talent-sourcing-strategy/) lead to hiring candidates that cannot augment the company’s productivity.

For the same reason, HR professionals endeavor to limit mistakes during the recruitment process. Let’s dive into the five common recruitment mistakes that HR professionals and interviewers must avoid. 

## **1\. Not Providing a Comprehensive Job Description**

A JD (job description) is a must for a recruitment drive. It is a written narrative incorporating the duties and responsibilities associated with a job role. It gives the candidates a clear understanding of their role in the company.

Without a JD, all tasks may fall under ‘other duties’ for employees. Things can get complicated when employees do not understand their job roles precisely.

Candidates may also not find the connection between their responsibilities and the company’s success. On the other hand, if a job opening is advertised with a comprehensive JD, suitably skilled candidates will apply and get hired as well.

## **2\. A Poor/Generic Application Structure** 

Job applications are among the first things encountered by candidates. A poor/generic job application can degrade the company’s reputation from the onset.

Job applications help HRs collect information related to the candidates. They should thus include fields that are directly related to the job opening. For example, the candidate’s education history and prior experience can be asked for in the job application.

Usually, HR professionals refrain from including personal details in the job application. What’s the point of asking about the religion or ethnicity of a candidate in the job application? By removing irrelevant fields from the job application, a company can have a positive impact on the candidates from the onset.

## **3\. Bad Interview Conduct** 

Interviewers might take their time to extract all they need to know about the candidate. Often, technical and HR interviews can be quite lengthy.

During the interview, the candidate should feel comfortable and relaxed. Instead of being anxious, candidates should be able to interact freely with the interviewer. However, some interviewers intimidate candidates and exhibit disorderly conduct.

Such behavior will lend a bad name to the company and deteriorate the [candidate’s experience](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/5-steps-improve-candidate-experience/) and perception of the recruiter. Even the best candidates might decide not to join a company because of a horrible experience with the interviewer.

## **4\. Not Checking the Candidates’ References** 

Not all candidates are honest and fill in the appropriate details in their job applications. For example, candidates sometimes add fake their work experience or educational qualifications.

HR professionals need to weed out such candidates to improve their [recruitment process](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/). Candidate references mentioned in resumes should be cross-checked before starting the recruitment process.

It is better to reject dishonest candidates before starting interviews or written tests for recruitment. HR professionals that ignore candidate references might end up with poor-quality talent. 

## **5\. Failing to Follow Up With Interviewees**

Lack of proper communication will lead to a bad dismal experience. Many recruiters do not send follow-up emails/messages to candidates after the interview session.

Candidates might become weary of not hearing response and move on to the next company. What’s the point of maintaining silence when you have all the resources to communicate with the candidates?

Recruiters/interviewers should thus proactively send follow-up emails, messages, posts, and letters to candidates. Even if a candidate is rejected after the interview, it is better to inform them via mail. Maintaining a steady line of communication ensures that employer reputation and candidate experience are sustained. 

## **Summing Up** 

Apart from the aforementioned mistakes, recruiters might also falter at testing the formal competency and skillset of candidates. Such errors deteriorate the recruitment process and the quality of talent.

Therefore, recruiters must have a definite hiring strategy. Finding a reliable recruitment partner can help HR professionals reduce and eliminate mistakes. Minimize your recruitment mistakes in 2022 to find the top talent!
