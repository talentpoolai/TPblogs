Every company is seasoned to hire freshers. However, there is a need for attention to finer details with senior-level hiring. The [talent pool](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/) is often smaller for starters, and they expect professionalism and processes of a much higher gradient. 

It’s essential to get everyone on the **same page** before recruiting. All the decision-makers must come from the same school of thought. It’s critical to define precisely what characteristics, roles, and responsibilities they are looking forward to delegate.

Here are three of the most critical aspects to consider while hiring a senior-level employee:  

## 1\. Long-Term Commitment

A hiring process comes riddled with overheads of its own. It’s not viable for the company to constantly spend time, effort, and workforce all year long, especially with senior-level positions. 

For the above reason, it’s important to **[justify the cost of hiring](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/tips-to-hire-cost-effectively/)**. The person should seem to commit to the company in the long run. We can also gauge this quality by understanding their resilience in past roles.

They must also align with the **vision and the mission** of the establishment. This factor becomes all the more critical when higher-up on the chain of command. Outside of the resume, they must also remain a **cultural fit** to the company. Joining at a senior level comes with the challenges of adapting to a new working environment.

At the time of hiring for such a position, we must look for a person who is ready to invest that kind of time in the business and the organization.

Additionally, ask them, “**Why are they looking for a move**?” A person looking for a change of company often considers specific parameters or looks for an upgrade. It is critical to understand these factors so a similar situation does not arise at your workplace. 

This also implies that you must set clear **expectations** about the role offered. Although industry experience is a great teacher, offerings change from company to company. They must not remain in the dark about any aspect of the job- their duties, remuneration, or growth prospects. 

## 2\. Big Picture Perspective

Consider what changes they could bring to the establishment when hired. Each leader brings in an inevitable wave of fresh approaches and practices. An employee must hone the ability to articulate these changes and present a roadmap of what initiatives they wish to kickstart. All of this must remain within the framework of the company to ensure **business alignment**. 

A leader should also come up with a unique approach to **process management which should be a foundation of growth.** A leader should have the unique ability to anticipate changes and be prepared.

## 3\. People Management 

It's imperative to understand how this senior leader manages, leads, and grows a team. A leader must **encourage a culture that promotes transparency, appreciation for good ideas, constant learning, and the freedom to experiment**, even at the cost of failure. 

A leader must remain keen to let people **grow and understand the aspirations** of others. Sometimes, it is also required to relate a viewpoint of others by putting themselves into that situation. The harmony and output of the business establishment are quickly diminished if there are conflicts. Any of these pitfalls are a dent in the business and the existing team. 

Additionally, a good senior should lay down processes to facilitate improvement. They must facilitate change and drive the most effective results from any group of people. All this without creating hostility or favoritism in the workplace comes from clear foresight and experience. 

One way to clarify these actions is by checking their history with the previous organization or project. Qualities like work ethic, teamwork, people management skills do not depend on an organization; it’s one they carry with them forever.   

## In Closing

Lastly, consider **internal promotions** before you step into the bubble of hiring. Internal employees, who have spent some time in the organization, align with the company's ideologies. They understand the culture that the leaders want to promote and can uphold the values better than an outsider.

Work from a list of expectations and navigate your way backward. Rather than looking for the perfect candidate, look for the ideal one. As Jim Collins, the author of Good To Great, once said:  “People are not the most critical asset; the right kind of person is.”
