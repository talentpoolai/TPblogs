  metaTitle: How Integrated Technology Makes Hiring Faster & Smarter | Talentpool
  metaDescription: >-
    Learn ways integrated tools like applicant tracking, video interviewing, and assessment platforms help you hire smarter, faster and with better quality.

Hiring today can feel like you are doing three jobs at once: recruiter, project manager, and "human reminder bot." And when you're juggling multiple roles, especially with niche skills, even a tiny delay can lead to missed candidates, messy handoffs, and hiring managers asking for updates every two hours.

But to resolve this, most teams don't need _more_ hiring help. They need a smarter, more connected setup, the kind where your tools integrate with each other and reduce manual workload with the most advanced technology. That is why it is not surprising that 75% of recruiters use an ATS or another tech-driven recruiting tool to review applicants.\*

So in this blog, we'll break down the hiring help that actually makes the recruitment management system work harder for you and how the right integrations can keep your hiring workflow moving without the complexity.
