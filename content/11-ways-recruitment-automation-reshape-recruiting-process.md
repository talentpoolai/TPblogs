In this age of stiff competition, organizations are constantly striving to be better than others in the industry. It won't be wrong to say that a talented workforce is a real advantage that any company has in today's age. This is why hiring is a top priority for CXOs.

Meeting the hiring numbers and onboarding the best talent has become a challenge in the current times of great resignation. As more and more employees are resigning, the hiring demand has shot up staggeringly. As per a report, the hiring activity has increased by 40% this year compared to last year.

In this scenario, recruiters alone can't fill the open positions. They need technology to meet organizational demands and bring efficiencies to the hiring process.

## How Can Recruitment Automation Reshape the Hiring Process?

Let us see how an organization can use technology in different aspects of the hiring process for better results:

### 1\. Automated Job Advertising

Your job postings will get the best results when they reach the desired audience.

Automated digital advertisements enable you to gain attention from a broader and more relevant audience base on the internet. Moreover, this technology helps you reduce advertising costs by giving a better ROI.

### 2\. Pre-Screening Candidates

As per a survey, every job interview attracts 250 resumes. This huge number makes it challenging for recruiters to go through every application. As a result, they end up spending only a few seconds on each application.

With technology on their side, recruiters no longer have to manually screen every application that comes their way. Instead, technological platforms can do it for them and allow them to read only the relevant resumes.

### 3\. First-Level Automated Interviews

At times, recruiters get impressed with the CV and call the applicant for an interview. However, they are disappointed because the candidate does not fit their criteria. This is a waste of time and effort. 

Recruiters can resolve this problem by automating the first level of interviews. Some chatbots can interview the candidates and confirm they are fit for the organization and role. You can also use video interviews where the candidates have to answer a few pre-programmed questions. 

These tools can help you call only qualified applicants for the interview and develop a more efficient hiring process.

### 4\. Scoring and Ranking Candidates

Some chatbots and video interview platforms also give the additional feature of scoring the candidates on your criteria.

For instance, you can share your requirement for communication and technical skills. These tools can evaluate the candidates on these aspects and give an overall score. 

Moreover, the tools can rank the candidates and help you engage with only the most qualified ones for further rounds in the hiring process.

### 5\. Automated Scheduling

More often than not, recruiters have to spend considerable time managing the calendars of the candidates and hiring managers. As a result, they do not get the time to focus on more meaningful aspects of their jobs.

Some technological tools can automate this tedious and time-consuming task of the [hiring process](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/7-reasons-why-candidates-drop-out-from-hiring-process/). These tools interact directly with the candidates and the hiring managers to schedule the interviews.

### 6\. Applicant Tracking

Once an applicant has entered the hiring funnel of your organization, there will be multiple touchpoints. Keeping track of the status of every applicant becomes a task in any organization. 

Applicant Tracking Systems keep all the incoming resumes in one place and allow the recruiters to retrieve their information as required. Some of them can rank and score the candidates as well. 

Apart from this, recruiters can use keyword searches on these tools to find relevant resumes from the existing database.

### 7\. Social Recruiting

In today's time, there is no better place than social media to find qualified candidates. Social recruiting allows you to post your job vacancies on social media platforms and do much more. 

For instance, you can reach passive candidates through your company's social media page. Secondly, you can create engaging content and showcase your company's culture to catch job-seekers interest in your company. 

### 8\. Background Verification

Gone are the days when recruiters had to call in and check the references shared by the candidates. These days, third-party teams run background verification checks for organizations.

Technology allows for integrating their [platforms](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/) with in-house onboarding systems for seamless movement of information. They enable lesser TAT and reduced cost, along with faster onboarding of the candidates.

### 9\. Candidate Rediscovery

Several times, recruiters come across qualified candidates, but things don't go ahead due to some reasons. Perhaps a suitable role is not open, or the salary expectations do not match. Recruiters have the best intention to connect with them in the future but fail to keep track of their information.

Technology can help in candidate rediscovery and save time and hiring costs. Moreover, these platforms maintain constant engagement with such candidates. As a result, they are always in the loop about what is happening at your organization. 

### 10\. Automated Communication

One of the major concerns of candidates is that recruiters go missing in action after contacting them or after they have given an interview.

Recruiters come across and meet hundreds of candidates in a month. Emailing every single of them every time they move further in the hiring funnel is a challenging task. 

You can thus automate communicati on to keep the candidates updated. 

### 11\. Better Candidate Engagement

Finally, all these tools help engage the candidate and keep them committed. This is essential for employer branding and keeping the candidates interested in future roles.

Every candidate will talk about their experience with their colleagues, friends, or family. Better candidate engagement thus helps you get positive word of mouth in the industry.

## Conclusion

Contrary to the popular idea that technology will replace humans in the HR function, technology can, in fact, bring in more efficiencies. It can assist recruiters in making hiring a smoother process and a better candidate experience.
