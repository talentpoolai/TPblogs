Let's talk about Smita! 

Smita is a talent acquisition manager at a mid-sized IT firm. With multiple open roles and a surge in applications, her inbox is flooding with resumes, follow-up emails, and pending interview lineups. The hiring team, working from different locations, struggles with miscommunication. Delays pile up, top talent walks away, and the company’s reputation takes a hit. 

Now, imagine if Smita’s team had centralised recruiting software that automates resume screening, tracks every applicant’s progress, and allows seamless collaboration across departments—anytime, anywhere.  That's something only a cloud-based candidate tracking system can offer. 

But is cloud-based [candidate management software](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/candidate-database-management/) the right solution for every business? In this blog post, we will share the pros and cons of cloud-based candidate tracking software to help you determine whether it aligns with your hiring strategy. 

## **What is a Cloud-Based ATS?** 

A candidate tracking system is [recruitment software](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/pros-and-cons-of-recruitment-software-for-high-growth-companies/) that helps talent acquisition teams manage job applications, track candidates, and streamline the hiring process from a single dashboard. It eliminates manual tracking through spreadsheets, ensuring a structured, organised approach to recruitment. 

A cloud-based candidate tracking software or ATS takes this a step further by hosting all hiring data on remote servers, accessible from anywhere with an internet connection. Unlike on-premises solutions that require heavy IT infrastructure, cloud-based systems provide scalability, real-time collaboration, and automation, making it easier for recruiters to source, screen, and engage with candidates efficiently. 

## **Pros of Cloud-Based Candidate Tracking Systems** 

### **Accessibility & Flexibility** 

One of the biggest advantages of a cloud-based candidate tracking system is its ability to provide access to hiring data anytime and anywhere. This feature is particularly valuable for remote hiring teams or companies that operate across multiple locations. It allows recruiters, hiring managers, and stakeholders to collaborate and reduce delays in decision-making.  

Additionally, for companies hiring across different time zones, cloud-based candidate management software ensures that updates, feedback, and applicant progress are available in real time. 

### **Omnichannel Communication** 

Effective communication is extremely crucial to attracting, engaging, and converting top talent. A cloud-based candidate tracking software improves communication between different stakeholders in the hiring process by integrating multiple channels like emails, SMS, phone calls, WhatsApp, and social media platforms into a single system. This is also useful in improving response times. 

### **Cost-Effectiveness** 

A cloud-based candidate tracking system is a cost-effective alternative to on-premises recruitment software, which requires significant upfront investments in IT infrastructure, servers, and ongoing maintenance. Instead, cloud-based solutions follow a subscription-based model that allows businesses to pay only for what they use. 

Additionally, cloud-based candidate tracking software minimises hidden costs, such as software updates, server maintenance, and security enhancements, as these are handled directly by the service provider.  

### **Scalability** 

Hiring needs fluctuate over time, especially for businesses going through peak growth phases or seasonal hiring surges. A cloud-based candidate management system offers the flexibility to scale recruitment operations up or down without the need for additional infrastructure. 

### **Integration with Other HR Tools** 

For recruitment to be truly efficient, candidate tracking systems must integrate easily with existing HR technology. A cloud-based candidate management software is built for easy integration with payroll software, HRMS, background verification tools, job boards, and third-party candidate sourcing tools. 

For instance, Talentpool Recruitment Software in India integrates with leading job boards, social media platforms, and HRMS solutions to help recruiters post job openings, screen applications, and onboard new hires, all within a single platform.  

### **Automatic Updates & Maintenance** 

Keeping recruitment technology up to date is essential for security, compliance, and feature enhancements. One of the biggest advantages of cloud-based candidate management system is that all updates, patches, and new features are automatically implemented by the provider. Therefore, recruiters don’t have to worry about installing updates manually or experiencing system downtime due to outdated software.  

## **Cons of Cloud-Based Candidate Tracking Systems** 

### **Data Security & Privacy Concerns** 

Since cloud-based candidate management systems store sensitive candidate data on third-party servers, companies may worry about data breaches, unauthorised access, or compliance risks.  

However, if you are opting for the best recruiting software like Talentpool, you don’t have to worry about security compliance. Talentpool is AWS-hosted and follows strict security protocols, including multi-layer encryption and access control mechanisms to ensure that candidate data remains secure and protected at all times. 

### **Internet Dependency & Downtime Risks** 

With cloud-based candidate management systems operating entirely online, they are dependent on stable internet connectivity. If a company experiences network downtime, recruiters may lose access to critical hiring data, which can further cause delays in the recruitment process.  

While most cloud-based recruitment software providers offer high uptime guarantees, businesses should have backup internet connectivity solutions in place to avoid any disruption. 

### **Expenses Over Time** 

While cloud-based candidate tracking software doesn’t require a costly upfront investment, companies must take the long-term subscription costs into account. For organisations with high hiring volumes, additional expenses may arise from: 

- Extra storage or user licenses 

- Premium features like AI-driven candidate sourcing tools 

- API access for third-party integrations 

If you want to maximise ROI, compare different pricing plans, evaluate feature sets, and ensure that their candidate management software provides scalability without excessive cost escalation. 

### **Integration Challenges with Legacy Systems** 

For companies using older HR software or custom-built recruitment management systems, integrating cloud-based candidate tracking systems can sometimes be challenging. Not all cloud-based [recruitment software](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/enhancing-recruitment-success-the-impact-of-a-candidate-management-system/) supports data migration or integration with legacy systems. 

Without proper API support, businesses may face workflow disruptions, duplicate data entries, or compatibility issues. This can slow down hiring processes and require additional custom development to ensure smooth functionality. 

To avoid such roadblocks, organisations should check API capabilities, integration options, and vendor support before implementing cloud-based candidate sourcing tools.  

## **Who Should Choose a Cloud-Based Candidate Tracking System?**

- With remote hiring needs or multiple office locations 

- Looking for scalable recruitment solutions 

- With a preference for vendor-managed security and automatic software updates
