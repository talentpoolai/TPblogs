Recruitment is a daunting task for any company. HR professionals have to find the right talent to boost the company’s growth. To successfully do this, they depend on multiple staffing and recruitment agencies.

To this end, this blog explores how Talentpool’s vendor management tool can help HR professionals.

## **Understanding the Need for a Vendor Management System** 

A company has professional relationships with many agencies for hiring purposes. These external agencies can be talent acquisition firms, staffing firms, or [recruitment](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/blogs/digital-age-hiring-whats-next-in-the-recruitment-world/) partners.

Since hiring can get complicated, companies rely on external partners for support. These external partners help companies identify and access the talent pools in the industry.

HR professionals often have to collaborate with these external partners. Not to forget, data related to all the external partners have to be stored centrally by HR professionals. It can be a hassle to manage multiple recruitment agencies manually for hiring.

For the same reason, companies depend on vendor management systems. HR professionals can experience a sudden increase in productivity after using Talentpool’s vendor management system. Let’s see how. 

## **How Talentpool’s Vendor Management System Can Help**

The vendor management solution offered by [Talentpool](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/) can help HR professionals in several ways: 

### 1\. **Avoiding Duplicate Profiles** 

Traditional databases might often contain duplicate entries of vendors. Duplicate vendor entries are also observed in manual documents maintained by HR professionals.

While traversing through vendor profiles, identical profiles can increase complexity. The time is taken to find a vendor profile also increases.

Not to forget, HR professionals can get confused due to duplicate vendor profiles. With Talentpool’s vendor management system, duplicate profiles can be eliminated with the least manual effort. 

### 2\. **Process Improvement** 

The modern-day job market is dynamic and competitive. If a company’s HR professionals cannot acquire top talent, another company might recruit them instead.

Recruitment professionals often look for [automation technologies](https://www.thetalentpool.ai/recruitment-management-software-features.html) that enable process improvement. Without process improvement, a recruiter will be outpaced by other recruiters in finding the top talent.

All recruitment processes should be streamlined, and HR professionals should not feel burned out. With Talentpool’s vendor management system, managing and maintaining vendors becomes simple and processes can be easily automated and improved. 

### 3\. **Increase in Visibility** 

A lot of information passes to and from recruitment partners. However, not all information is needed at the same time.

For example, for a senior job role, HR professionals only want to view the talent pool of working employees in the industry.

Similarly, recruiters might want to track down a particular hiring partner for some reason. With Talentpool’s vendor management system, recruiters can easily access any information as required. 

### 4\. **Enhanced Collaboration**

Recruitment software with a built-in vendor management system can help a company view the communication status with any hiring partner. It helps in enhanced collaboration with any hiring partner when needed.

HR professionals can proactively work with the hiring partners when they have access to a vendor management system like Talentpool’s. 

### 5\. **Making Data-Driven Decisions** 

Vendor management systems like Talentpool's have a lot to offer, from powerful reporting metrics to critical insights. HR professionals can use data insights to make better decisions while recruiting candidates.

In addition, powerful insights can help HR professionals track the efficiency of the recruitment process. They can also apply performance analytics to determine the effectiveness of a hiring partner.

## **In a Nutshell** 

Vendor management systems are the latest innovation in HR tech and can help boost overall productivity. Recruitment software that includes a vendor management system is thus a must in 2022.

Talentpool’s vendor management system is a next-gen solution that can help HR professionals manage multiple hiring partners. Upgrade to Talentpool’s vendor management solution right away!
